This transformation started with Bloomberg Second Measure (BSM), a data product for understanding company performance and consumer trends using consumer transaction data. These financial transactions are the foundation upon which we build as we acquire, ingest, enrich, and distribute additional alternative data sets to innovate through our novel and valuable data products.

The Alternative Data Platform team is a software and systems engineering team focused on providing a usable, scalable, and reliable platform for building data products from alternative data. Our platform provides primitives and abstractions enabling our users to creatively solve problems and run the powerful analytical workflows necessary for alternative data. We empower our users to focus on the data by reducing the pain and frustration of using existing data and analytics tools, and adopt new and innovative technologies to enable the continuous evolution necessary for innovation.

As the foundational engineering team supporting alternative data, the team has two core responsibilities:

Design, build, and maintain the data processing platform that empowers data scientists, data analysts, and data engineers to rapidly prototype and autonomously build, develop, and release data products
Design, build, and maintain the query and data infrastructure critical to the research, development, and publication of alternative data
We run our platform in AWS. We build upon open-source technologies such as Kubernetes, Spark, Argo Workflows, Argo Events, and Trino in addition to adopting and supporting open standards such as OpenAPI, CloudEvents, and Open Lineage. Our users inform and guide our roadmap. Together, we evolve and deliver an ambitious vision for how to develop data products.


What's in it for you:
You'll be part of a diverse team with varying levels of experience and backgrounds that work together to create the platform. We support each other where we have expertise and become experts together where we have none. We seek input and feedback from our teammates, valuing open discussion and collaboration.

Building APIs to orchestrate deployments and execution of data processing systems.
Prototype data and analytics technologies to adopt and incorporate into our platform.
Use established and existing technologies in novel ways to solve our problems.
Integrate and manage cloud resources and services.
Create tools and UIs to enhance usability and developer autonomy
We'll trust you to:
Build and maintain systems that are scalable, reliable, and usable while simplifying the complexities for the benefit of our users
Take ownership in the design and implementation of technical solutions from start to finish including prototyping, development, testing, and release.
Collaborate with your team and the wider engineering organization and Alternative Data product teams to achieve the team's goals.
Own the infrastructure, services, systems used to provide the platform.
Write and review code, develop documentation, debug problems with large, distributed, and complex systems.
You'll need to have:
4+ Years working with one or more of our development language (Python, Go, Typescript) and libraries, frameworks, and APIs within those languages.
A Degree in Computer Science, Engineering, Mathematics, similar field of study or equivalent work experience
Experience building, maintaining, and debugging production systems and services such as cloud infrastructure, load balancers and APIs.
Curiosity for investigating and understanding all areas of the platform whether it is working with AWS VPCs, improving a CLI used by developers, or understanding the primitive and logical types in a supported file format.
Experience with distributed systems and service architectures.
We'd love to see:
Polyglot engineers that are comfortable with using multiple languages for building production systems
Experience in and around technical data systems such as Spark, Flink, Dask, Clickhouse, Druid and technologies such as Parquet, Iceberg, and cloud object-stores.
Support of production systems with knowledge of Linux, networking (transport and application layer protocols), and deploying systems and services using Kubernetes, Mesos or Nomad.
Experience building on Kubernetes using the operator pattern, admission webhooks, and other services that work with the Kubernetes API.
Prior design and automating operations cloud infrastructure such as AWS, GCP, Azure using tools such as Terraform and Ansible
