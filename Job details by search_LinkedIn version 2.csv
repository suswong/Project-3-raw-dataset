In 1951 SF Fire Credit Union first opened its doors from a modest 10′ × 15′ office space in 17 Engine. It was from those humble beginnings—where everyone pitched in to help one another in their community—that the organization forged its way of business forever.

Our members benefit from the ideas and principles that have shaped us: Shared trust, continuous innovation of products and services, competitive rates, and excellent member service. These qualities foster a true sense of member-ownership and strengthen the credit union’s bond with the people for whom this credit union was created.

        ","About Pipe

Pipe is a new kind of trading platform that enables entrepreneurs to grow their businesses on their terms. By treating recurring revenue streams as an asset, Pipe allows companies to transform their recurring revenue into up-front capital, instantly. For entrepreneurs, that means more cash flow for scaling a business without dilution or restrictive debt. For investors, Pipe has unlocked a previously untapped asset class. Whether you're an entrepreneur or an investor, Pipe is growth on your terms.

We're a fully distributed, remote-first, fast-growing startup. Our engineering and data teams are spread from UTC-8 to UTC+6 and we rely heavily on our written communication skills in order to make it work. We believe in giving our team agency and control over their schedules: we avoid standing meetings, and default to asynchronous communication. There are no core working hours, we just ask our team to communicate clearly about their schedules and be considerate to their coworkers if plans change. You will occasionally need to be flexible in order to meet synchronously with colleagues in different time zones.

Role

This is a full-time, fully-remote position as a Data Analyst. In this role, you will:

Work closely with product and commercial teams to understand business performance, and define metrics and KPIs.
Identify opportunities to unlock growth and efficiency in the business.
Build dashboards and reports to create visibility into different funnels and business processes.
Design and run experiments to improve customer experience on the platform.
Proactively explore datasets to uncover insights, and prototype new model-driven features and products that provide value to our customers.


Qualifications

We are looking for talented data analysts with past experience in a similar role. Ideal candidates will have:

Expert-level proficiency in SQL and experience working with ETL/ELT pipelines and BI tools. Experience with a scripting language is a plus.
A passion for digging into datasets to validate hypotheses and uncover insights.
Strong written and verbal communication skills.
Experience designing and running A/B tests is a plus.
Prior experience in fintech or finance is a plus.


In general, you will be successful at Pipe if:

You want to join a quickly growing startup and make an impact.
You want to be part of a team that holds each other to high standards.
You have a strong technical foundation, and are passionate about using your toolkit to help our customers succeed.
You take end-to-end ownership of your work and enjoy working with different functions across the company.
You have strong written and verbal communication skills.
You want to work in an environment that values and rewards excellence.


Many good candidates do not fit job descriptions perfectly. If you believe you are a good fit, we encourage you to apply.

Tech Stack

We are committed to using the right tools for the problems we are trying to solve. Currently our stack is mostly comprised of:

PostgreSQL, dbt, BigQuery, Spark, Superset, Baseten, Airflow


Compensation And Benefits

We want you to feel like an owner and that will be reflected in your salary and equity.
The best equipment: if you want it, and it helps you do your job, we'll provide it. Computers, monitors, desks, chairs, headphones, speakers, microphones, webcams, keyboards, mice, etc.
A good work-life balance: we do our best work when we can regularly step away from it and live our lives.
Flexible vacation and work hours. We don't adopt conventional work practices that are meaningless for the type of work we do.
Parental leave for anyone who is growing their family, regardless of gender.
Very good health, dental, and vision insurance.
Great colleagues: we value a culture of authenticity, humility, and excellence.","

        ","Upwork ($UPWK) is the world’s work marketplace. We serve everyone from one-person startups to over 30% of the Fortune 100 with a powerful, trust-driven platform that enables companies and talent to work together in new ways that unlock their potential.

Last year, more than $3.3 billion of work was done through Upwork by skilled professionals who are gaining more control by finding work they are passionate about and innovating their careers.

The Trust & Safety team seeks to deliver the trustworthy, safe, and inclusive work marketplace that sparks a global movement to reimagine work. We are looking for an intelligence analyst to help understand trends in serious fraud on our platform, and monitor and interpret the behavior of sophisticated fraud rings. You’ll partner closely with Trust & Safety Enforcement teams to understand intent and actors behind fraud activity on platform, and track evolution of modi operandi as our detection evolves.

Your Responsibilities:

You will work closely with teams across Trust & Safety to understand the evolving behavior of different fraud groups on the Upwork platform.
You will build sourcing processes from our operations teams to ensure the right information and cases reach you to develop insights.
You will conduct extensive off platform research to better understand how Upwork is being abused by fraud actors worldwide.
You will detail and prioritize clear, easy to understand requests for information on an as-needed basis for our Investigations and Analytics teams.
You will own and maintain our attribution guidelines for associating activity to a fraud ring, and evolve these guidelines as behavior shifts.
You will deliver regular, clear reporting on current trends in on-platform fraud conducted by organized/coordinated groups.


What it takes to catch our eye:

Experience in intelligence analysis, whether in the private sector, law enforcement, military, or intelligence community.
Experience conducting OSI (Open Source Intelligence) collection operations.
A self starter, able to stand up programs from the ground up, and build new processes from scratch
Comfortable both extrapolating intent from limited data and interpreting the results of large-scale analysis to understand trends.


The annual base salary for this position in California and Washington ranges from $71,000 - $129,000. The range displayed reflects the minimum and maximum salary for this position in California and Washington, and individual base pay will depend on your skills, qualifications, experience, and location.

Spry brings a unique blend of proven service delivery, scalable and agile corporate infrastructure, and the ability to recruit and retain the best and brightest in the industry to support our customers. The Spry team engages in exciting and rewarding opportunities that challenge their abilities, in an atmosphere that encourages both personal and professional growth, fostering a positive and energetic work environment.




Who We’re Looking For (Position Overview):




We are on the search for a Population Health Data Analyst to join our team in San Diego. The mission of Naval Medical Center San Diego (NMCSD) is to optimize the health of its beneficiaries through critically needed Public Health programs. In order to optimize the performance in support of accomplishing its mission, the Public Health program requires the services of data analyst services to provide real-time information. This contract and its respective deliverables will support NMCSD in ensuring that its Public Health mission is met.




What Your Day-To-Day Looks Like (Position Responsibilities):




The Employee shall participate in preparing, reviewing and presenting briefings, memos and white papers in support of San Diego Public Health efforts. It is expected that NMCSD Public Health briefings will be prepared and delivered to NMCSD, BUMED, DHA and/or MHS leadership approximately every 6-8 weeks. Presentations and briefings will normally be delivered by the government lead; however there may be occasions when the Employee will be expected to deliver presentations as a back-up to the government lead or co-present certain sections of the presentations developed by the Employee. The Employee will normally attend all briefings with the government lead unless designated as government only. Additionally ad-hoc briefings and presentations for other external stakeholders (i.e., conferences, partner meetings, etc.) are anticipated to occur every 4-6 months and may require contract support in the development of content for such briefings and presentations
Assisting in the review, development, and implementation of processes and guidelines for all primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention modalities developed for NMCSD staff. Processes and guidelines will be developed and updated on a continuous basis throughout the duration of the contract on a bi-weekly basis
Providing analytic and presentation development support to NMCSD personnel participating in medical meetings, committees, professional associations, boards, and other related groups as necessary to support San Diego Public Health strategy development and implementation efforts. These events are anticipated to occur every 3-6 months
Maintain annual occupational health readiness and screening in accordance with NMCSD occupational guidelines
Maintain current training requirements as required by NMCSD (e.g. HIPAA, Information Assurance)
The Employee shall update and maintain a current electronic repository of San Diego Public Health documents and materials on the San Diego Public Health internal SharePoint site in accordance with guidelines and established procedures. This repository currently exists as a stand-alone Public Health SharePoint website on the NMCSD network, accessible through CAC access. Initial update due 30 DACA and updated weekly thereafter
The Employee shall manage existing Tertiary Prevention patient identification approaches through the use of advanced statistical software (such as Statistical Analysis Software). The existing approach involves running a query each month on the prior 12 months full history of San Diego TRICARE beneficiary claims data as reported in the M2 database. The Employee shall enhance the existing Tertiary Prevention Population Identification algorithms in order to further refine mechanisms to identify select specific High Utilizer patients. Performance on this task will be measured by the completion of monthly algorithms for identifying tertiary beneficiaries. In order to perform this task, the Government will grant the Employee query access to the M2 and MDR database. The Employee shall establish a data sharing agreement with the government prior to being granted access to the M2 and MDR database. Employee will have a data sharing agreement with the government completed before the contract award
The Employee shall create data-driven algorithms that will analyze patient claims and encounters data, as well as data sourced from local directories provided by NMCSD (i.e., health and wellness program enrollment rosters) to select patients or patient groups best suited for Primary, Secondary or Tertiary Interventions. Primary and Secondary interventions are defined as programs that help TRICARE beneficiaries manage and/or prevent disease and risk factors before they lead to the need for acute medical services. Specific algorithms for identifying beneficiaries for Primary and Secondary intervention have not yet been developed, and should be developed in a manner that will ultimately allow for them to be transitioned to government staff at NMCSD. Performance on this task will be measured by the monthly completion of Primary and Secondary interventions. A summary description of these algorithms will be documented in a report that is due 60 DACA and updated on a monthly basis, or more frequently as required
The Employee shall complete deep-dive and ad hoc analyses needed to drill-down into M2 and MDR data sets and algorithm results, including geospatial analyses, time series analyses, predictive modeling, etc. These analyses are estimated to be required every 6-8 weeks and will be used to support presentations and briefings as described in task 3.1.3.1 The Employee shall also design and implement self-service business intelligence and measurement reports as required that can be used by NMCSD staff to support Primary and Secondary prevention strategies


What You Need to Succeed (Minimum Requirements)




Management Analysis and Reporting Tool (M2): The MHS Management Analysis and Reporting Tool (M2) is an informatics tool that combines a powerful commercial ad hoc query and reporting tool with MHS data originating from clinical, financial, and beneficiary demographic domains. M2 data is accessed to perform trend analyses, conduct patient and provider profiling studies, and realize opportunities for transferring health care from the private sector to military treatment facilities. M2 includes inpatient, outpatient, and ancillary direct and purchased care data as well as eligibility and enrollment data
Military Health System Data Repository: The Military Health System Data Repository (MDR) is the centralized data repository that captures, archives, validates, integrates and distributes Defense Health Agency (DHA) corporate health care data worldwide. It receives and validates data from the Department of Defense’s (DoD) worldwide network of more than 260 health care facilities and from non-DoD data sources. The MDR applies data quality edits to maximize the value of DHA corporate data. It also provides online and near-line data storage and supports health care data transfers
MHS Genesis: A medical informatics system used by all military and veterans administration health care centers. It is the primary source for medical record and appointing information for all beneficiaries.
CarePoint: An informatics tool that provides clinical staff with the ability to efficiently assess the status of their enrolled patients for specific conditions.

Rippling is the first way for businesses to manage all of their HR & IT—payroll, benefits, computers, apps, and more—in one unified workforce platform.




By connecting every business system to one source of truth for employee data, businesses can automate all of the manual work they normally need to do to make employee changes. Take onboarding, for example. With Rippling, you can just click a button and set up a new employees’ payroll, health insurance, work computer, and third-party apps—like Slack, Zoom, and Office 365—all within 90 seconds.




Based in San Francisco, CA, Rippling has raised $700M from the world’s top investors—including Kleiner Perkins, Founders Fund, Sequoia, and Bedrock—and was named one of America’s best startup employers by Forbes (#12 out of 500).

        ","GRAIL is a healthcare company whose mission is to detect cancer early, when it can be cured. GRAIL is focused on alleviating the global burden of cancer by developing pioneering technology to detect and identify multiple deadly cancer types early. The company is using the power of next-generation sequencing, population-scale clinical studies, and state-of-the-art computer science and data science to enhance the scientific understanding of cancer biology, and to develop its multi-cancer early detection blood test. GRAIL is headquartered in Menlo Park, CA with locations in Washington, D.C., North Carolina, and the United Kingdom. GRAIL, LLC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN).

Maintain data integrity and quality throughout the data lifecycle, including ensuring clinical study-related blinding where appropriate.


Preferred Background

BS or MS in a scientific field (life science, computer science, engineering, mathematics, statistics, bioinformatics, etc.).
Experience with R or Python programming is required
Experience with basic concepts of molecular biology is required
Experience with cross-functional collaboration while ensuring data quality and commitment to analysis reproducibility is required

        ","Our Goal

Ensure no property is bought, sold, held, or rented without an accurate, property specific climate risk assessment.







The Problem

The problem with climate risk today is that there is no easy, accurate, accessible, and trusted way to understand physical climate risk at a property level. Climate based disasters cause billions in property damage every year and are increasing dramatically. The best science highlighting the issue is complex, happening in silos, and left in peer reviewed journals. Because of this, millions of Americans are making the biggest investment decision of their lives without a true understanding of their risk.




Risk Factor (riskfactor.com) solves this problem for flooding, wildfire, and extreme heat and we are just getting started. Not only do we have millions of users, in two short years we have seen Risk Factor integrated with top real estate websites like Realtor.com, adopted by 30+ Federal government agencies, used daily by top institutional investors like Nuveen, and leveraged in portfolio analysis by all Federal Reserve Banks.







The Opportunity

We have started a revolution in climate risk data, we have proven product market fit, and we have millions in ARR while still staying true to our non-profit climate mission. We are trailblazing a path to create a new philanthropic model that moves away from donors and is entirely self-sustaining ensuring predictable revenue and continued growth and impact. It is with this foundation that we want to supercharge growth. To do this, we are looking for an expert Data Engineer to join our team.







The Role

The Data Engineer must be someone who deeply cares about the environment, loves information technology, and appreciates the importance of data for the success of the First Street mission. The Data Engineer will lead the ingestion of climate risk and ancillary data from First Street modeling and data partners, develop data pipelines, manage geospatial databases, calculate applicable statistics, implement Quality Assurance and Quality Control processes, utilize geographical imagery, and ensure that the Data Team’s databases and pipelines are coordinated and synchronized with the Software Engineering Team’s databases, APIs, and web services. This individual will be responsible for developing data operations across the Data Team, and through their expertise and leadership generally enabling all members of the Data Team to be successful in their roles.







What’s in it for you?

For your hard work you will be rewarded with a competitive salary, bonuses based on company growth goals, generous paid time off, a stipend to deck out your home workstation and the opportunity to work for the most trafficked climate risk website in the country.




Responsibilities will include, but are not limited to:

At ConvertFlow, we're helping brands own their growth and stay independent of big tech platforms that seek to control how consumers shop and who they shop with.

Today, ConvertFlow empowers businesses of all sizes, from entrepreneurs with big visions, to iconic brands like Porsche, Audi, Volkswagen, Nectar.

        ","Organizational Setting

The Animal Production and Health Division (NSA) promotes and facilitates the sustainable development of the livestock sector, integrating scientific, technical expertise and policy advice. It hosts technical networks in areas of animal genetics, feed and pastoralism, among others. It provides analysis and technical assistance, and facilitates policy dialogue (incl. intergovernmental bodies).

The consultancy is located in the Animal Production and Genetics Branch (NSAG). The Unit generates information and manages knowledge, facilitates the development and implementation of innovative solutions and provides technical expertise to improve productivity, efficiency and resilience of livestock production. The activities of the Unit cover all production systems, from pastoralism to industrial, including crop-livestock integrated systems; and aim to enhance their sustainability.

Reporting Lines

Under the direct supervision of the NSAG Animal Production Officer, and in close consultation and collaboration with relevant colleagues in FAO HQ and decentralized offices and partners, the incumbent will support NSAG’s work related to data collection for the Domestic Animal Diversity Information System (DAD-IS).

Technical Focus

Population size is a valuable indicator of a breed’s risk of extinction, which is used for the computation of SDG Indicator 2.5.2. Breed-based censuses and to a certain extent herdbooks for pedigree registration are accurate tools for monitoring breed population sizes, but are generally costly, require important logistic and governance capacities, and are not available for most breed populations in developing countries and for many breeds in developed countries, especially for certain species.

Estimating population size by sampling and/or other approaches is a relatively inexpensive approach that, when properly applied, still yields reasonably accurate results. FAO has already developed some methods for estimating population sizes of breeds and tested them in several countries. However, these methods are not appropriate in all circumstances, and further innovation is needed. Methods for estimating colony numbers are also needed to monitor the diversity of managed honey bees. The technical focus is on developing low-cost and cost-effective methods for estimating the size of breed populations in livestock species and the number of bee-colonies.

Tasks And Responsibilities

Provide a literature and technical review of methods on estimation of breed population sizes including the one developed by FAO based on stratified-sampling considering the desired precision of estimates, the degree of accuracy and related costs.
Participate in one mission to FAO HQ to meet relevant colleagues and partners.
Develop a structured questionnaire that helps to collect information on implementation constraints, challenges experienced, and solutions found related to collection/estimation of breed population size data. This should be based on the literature review developed under the first bullet.
Conduct structured interviews (online or onsite) to gather information on implementation constraints, challenges experienced, and solutions found related to collection/estimation of breed population size data.
Based on the literature review and through the analysis of the information collected through the task above, prepare a document presenting alternative methods to estimate population sizes of breeds and the number of bee colonies for monitoring purpose, describing prerequisites for implementation and costs in relation to precision and degree of accuracy of the estimates.
Draft a step-by-step guide on the implementation of selected alternative low-cost methods in the field.
Assist in identifying countries and Service Providers for testing the proposed methods in the field.
Perform other duties as required.

CANDIDATES WILL BE ASSESSED AGAINST THE FOLLOWING

Minimum Requirements

University degree in statistics, mathematics, economics, agricultural economics, or a related field with training in statistics.
Five years of relevant field experience in statistical surveys and censuses.
For Consultants: working knowledge of English and limited knowledge of French, Spanish, Arabic, Chinese or Russian. For PSAs: working knowledge of English.
