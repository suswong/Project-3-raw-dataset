Feeling underappreciated? Underutilized? Want to be a part of a specialized team with exposure to a wide variety of data puzzles to solve, while using your skills to improve education? Come join a team where you can Fly the Airplane, not just be a passenger in the back. We're a growing company focused on expanding our Operations team with a solutions-focused Data Engineer. Sound interesting?




If so, we're looking for a motivated and driven person like you who has:




Strength in thinking creatively and collaborating with other data experts in figuring out solutions to really tough data loads or transformation problems
Experience leveraging SQL and/or ETL development, data mapping, and data modeling to manage and organize client data
A passion for continuous improvement in refining the approach and doing it better and faster the next time




Bonus points if you're bringing knowledge of or really want to learn the following:




Consultancy experience with a focus on Agile practices
AWS and Azure Cloud
Python or similar scripting languages
AWS Quicksight, Tableau, Power BI, or other visualization tools




In return, we offer:




A mission-driven company with a long-term focus on helping the world by untangling the technical knots that plague state and local governments, particularly in education, healthcare, and similar fields
A home where your voice matters and you can affect real change
An employer who cares about you, makes sure you're engaged with exciting work, and offers robust benefits, 401k with employer match, and a great culture




We do not want you to make the leap without knowing what we need, so here is how we define success for this position:




Soak up knowledge from the existing team of experts in the first 30 days
Bring fresh eyes to our processes and techniques and bring new ideas to the table in the first 2 months
Mentor a new data engineering hire in your first 90 days




We need to know - can you make this happen? If so, we definitely need to talk to you.




We value diversity at Double Line. We hire, recruit, and promote without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender, national origin, pregnancy or maternity, veteran status or any other status protected by applicable law. We understand the importance of creating a safe and comfortable work environment and encourage individualism and authenticity in every member of our team.




Double Line does not sponsor applicants for work visas at this time.




Double Line does not currently offer relocation assistance.

        ","What You'll Do

As our Senior Data Engineer, you will be responsible for the design, development and maintenance of high-performance, resilient, scalable data pipelines/platforms, providing clean and usable datasets into Preveta’s data applications and analytics.

Key responsibilities include

Work with product managers, analysts, subject matter experts, and the rest of the data team to identify valuable data/transformations/insights/metrics used to improve patient outcomes
Design and implement infrastructure, data pipelines, orchestration, and observability to efficiently source from multiple healthcare systems - with various access methods and data/file formats - into targeted applications and datasets
Identify and initiate infrastructure, development, and workflow improvements

Requirements

ABOUT YOU

The big picture:

At Preveta, we look for people who are empathetic, genuine, compassionate, and knowledgeable of the healthcare challenges in patient care. We are serious about improving the future of U.S. healthcare, but we never take ourselves too seriously, we want to see you love what you do.

For this role:

We are looking for someone who can engage with our team and clients to help provide clarity to the complexity. We want to see your love of data and building infrastructure.

We know people are so much more than their resume – but to make sure someone is set up for success in this role, we’re looking for:

Self-starter that thrives in a remote-only work environment, being able to communicate effectively both synchronously and asynchronously
5+ years as a data engineer building key datasets and data pipelines against non-trivial source/target data sizes
Very strong SQL skills, with an intimate understanding of things like query tuning, DDL/DML, temp tables, window functions, and JSON queries, to write and maintain accurate and performant queries over large data sources.
Authorization to work in the United States


Preferences

Experience with teams that release frequently using CI/CD, infrastructure as code, and automated testing
Experience implementing data pipelines on cloud platforms (Azure, AWS, GCP) with platforms/tools like Azure Data Factory, Synapse Analytics, Azure Functions, Databricks, Spark, Airflow, Snowflake, Big Query, Redshift
Programming/scripting experience in any language
Familiarity with Data Lakehouse architectures
Familiarity with visualization/analytics model platforms like Power BI or Tableau
Experience working in a fast-growing SaaS start-up or eager to contribute in such an environment


Who We Are

Empathy and care are in our DNA-we are driven by a deep and instinctive desire to help others. When our founders’ dear friend Becky was diagnosed with ovarian cancer, coordination breakdowns impeded every step of her care. If not for these systemic barriers, Becky and millions in similar situations might still be alive. Preveta was created to ensure what happened to Becky wouldn’t happen to anyone else.

Our Guiding Principles

Authenticity-We are transparent, empathetic, and candid during every interaction. We strive to create a strong community grounded in honesty and genuine collaboration.

Growth-We focus on ensuring that every team member has the support and resources they need. As we grow internally, our impact increases exponentially.

Respect- We are committed to cultivating a culture of respect. We act kindly, listen fully, take each individual's perspective to heart, and engage with empathy.

Collaboration-Meaningful collaboration drives better results. We walk alongside each other through the challenges and the triumphs. The strength of the team is each individual member.

An individuality-Every person on the team brings their own character, know-how, background, insights, and questions to the Preveta community. We celebrate and honor these one-of-a-kind traits because they are the elements that help make up our dynamic team.

Benefits

WHY JOIN US?

We are in an incredibly exciting space as we work to scale a solution that helps save lives. We surround ourselves with people who inspire. We learn and grow from each other. We don’t have time for drama, we trust each other’s individual expertise. Our team is built on trust, curiosity, ingenuity, and playfulness. Our greatest tool is our people, our audacious vision and collaboration get the job done.

Besides being a part of something revolutionary and changing the way we do health care we provide benefits such as:

We provide a 100% remote work environment with a flexible schedule
Unlimited paid time off - for vacations, if you're sick, or if you just need a day
Healthcare benefits include - medical with telehealth, HSA, dental, vision, mental health
Reimbursements for your work expenses - for your equipment, and even down to that favorite color sticky note
Professional development reimbursements, you decide how to use it based on how you learn best


We value diversity on our team and strive to maintain a culture of inclusion and belonging. We believe that teams with different backgrounds and experiences bring uniquely valuable perspectives to our work, and a culture where people can be their authentic selves makes our team stronger and more successful. We’re building a culture grounded in candor, trust, and support of one another; an environment where we are stronger together than each of us could be on our own.

Kuali builds software solutions for higher education. We help our customers — colleges & universities — focus on providing a fantastic education to students by decreasing their administrative costs. We work in a competitive space, ripe for innovation, with users ready to be delighted.

Our Culture

As a company, we are guided by our cultural values:

Iterate to evolve
Cultivate openness
Act with accountability
Assume the best
Practice humility
Deliver amazing experiences


As Kuali engineers, we learn from and teach each other, we practice transparency and empathy, and we delight in delivering value to our customers.

We work remotely, and have for years. Distributed work is in our bones, with a history of institutions working across state lines on open-source software for more than ten years. Our employees each work in the environment where they’re happiest, from Pennsylvania to Hawaii. We work consciously to create a collaborative and healthy remote work culture, and we travel to meet in person a few times each year.

Everyone should love their work.

Kuali has been voted a top place to work for 5 years in a row by the Salt Lake Tribune. We also made Forbes' list of America's Best Startup Employers for 2020. Not too shabby.

Your product team

You will work closely with product, design, and our customers on the Kuali Financials product. Customers use our Financials product to efficiently and effectively manage the complex accounting needs of higher education.

Requirements

Who are you?

We’re looking for curious, enthusiastic, empathetic engineers to solve problems, execute on ideas, advocate for the customer, and contribute to a team culture built on trust and mutual respect. As a data engineer here, you’ll have a significant impact on what we do and how we do it.

We build and support data pipelines and reporting solutions for a range of business needs, including end user consumption. We are focusing heavily on greenfield development: you will build new analytics and data services including data pipelines, data warehousing solutions, ETL processes, end user reports, as well as the deployment mechanisms and the platform's environments. As a Data Engineer you will have the unique opportunity to influence major decisions from how our data platform's cloud-based infrastructure is architected, to what modern data-engineering frameworks and tooling are used, to how our CI/CD will operate. While building out the new platform, you will also maintain a light-weight, legacy solution, which will be deprecated and replaced. We believe that great developers can always learn new tools. Above any specific tech stack, we’re looking for versatile developers — those who know when to think big and when to act small, and who are comfortable in both greenfield and refactoring projects.

We believe the best products are created by teams who represent a broad range of ideas and perspectives. We value employees with diverse backgrounds and experiences.

You...

Have 3+ years of Data Engineering experience or equivalent.
Architecture-level experience conceptualizing and building infrastructure that processes, stores, and vends large data sets for analytics purposes at an enterprise scale in the cloud. Advanced SQL skills including database design best practices. CTEs, functions, stored procedures don't intimidate you.
Have hands-on experience with ETL-as-code frameworks such as Airflow, Luigi, or Prefect or experience building ETL processes/services from scratch with generic languages and libraries.
Experience developing and supporting reports with BI and reporting tools such as Tableau, Domo, Looker, or Sisense.
Understand the software development lifecycle and are able to work alongside development teams. You’re excited to collaborate closely with Application Engineers, Product Managers, and Customer Success and use real-time feedback to solve problems iteratively.
Are ready to help reformulate existing frameworks to improve and expand current offerings.
Aren’t afraid to get your hands dirty on devops work.


We'd be delighted if you bring experience with:

Shipping Software as a Service (SaaS) solutions
One or more of these technologies: Java, Python, Node.js, AWS
One or more relational databases: MySQL, Oracle or Postgres
One or more analytics databases: Redshift, Snowflake, or Teradata.
Report and dashboard requirements analysis and design
Front end development with React or Angular
The Higher Education community


Other things you should know:

This team is (and has always been) fully remote. You’d be expected to have a suitable home working environment or alternative. We try to get together in person as a team or company 2-4 times a year.


Benefits

Top-of-the-line equipment of your choice to get your job done
A truly exceptional benefits package including full premium coverage for employee and dependent medical and dental care
401(k) matching
Paid Maternity/Parental leave
All the paid time off you need (just work it out with your manager)

Are curious and passionate about digging into new technologies with a knack for picking them up quickly
Adept at prioritizing value and shipping complex products while coordinating across multiple teams

Strive to excel, innovate and take pride in your work
Work well with other leaders
Are a positive culture driver

        ","Clover is reinventing health insurance by working to keep people healthier.




We value diversity — in backgrounds and in experiences. Healthcare is a universal concern, and we need people from all backgrounds and swaths of life to help build the future of healthcare.




Clover's Data Team is charged with applying our data—our most important asset—to produce value for our members. From observing how the member experience impacts clinical outcomes to making our home visits more efficient and effective, our team pushes out automated and statistical insights central to executing on our main mission. And our impact is tremendous: you'll be able to point to one of our members and say, “I helped make that person's life better.”




The Job




We are looking for a Data Engineer to join our team. You'll work on the development of data pipelines and tools to support our analytics and machine learning development. Applying insights through data is a core part of our thesis as a company — and you will work on a team that is a central part of helping to deliver that promise through making a wide variety of data easily accessible for internal and external consumers. We work primarily in Python and our data is primarily stored in Postgres. You will work with data scientists, other engineers, and healthcare professionals in a unique environment building tools to improve the health of real people. You should have extensive experience leading data warehousing projects with advanced knowledge in data cleansing, ingestion, ETL and data governance.




As a Data Engineer, You Will




Collaborate closely with operations, IT and vendor partners to understand the data landscape and contribute to the vision, development and implementation of the Data Warehouse solution.
Recommend technologies and tools to support the future state architecture.
Develop standards, processes and procedures that align with best practices in data governance and data management.
Be responsible for logical and physical data modeling, load and query performance.
Create and manage ETL packages, triggers, stored procedures, views, and SQL transactions.
Develop new secure data feeds with external parties as well as internal applications.
Perform regular analysis and QA, diagnose ETL and database related issues, perform root cause analysis, and recommend corrective actions to management.
Work with cross-functional teams to support the design, development, implementation, monitoring, and maintenance of new ETL programs.




You Will Love This Job If




You value collaboration and feedback. You can communicate technical vision in clear terms— to your team and peers as well as outside of the engineering team.
You are quick to jump in to help fix things that are broken and you enjoy making sustainable systems. You are happy to fill in the gaps to reach a goal where necessary, even if it is outside of your job description.
You have a genuine interest in what good technology can do to help people and have a positive attitude about tackling hard problems in an important industry.
You enjoy working in a fluid environment, defining and owning priorities that adapt to our larger goals. You can bring clarity to ambiguity while remaining open-minded to new information that might change your mind.




You Should Get In Touch If




You have a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science or related field along with 3+ years of experience in ETL programming utilizing SSIS packages, DTS, stored procedures, and SQL scripts.
You have professional experience working in a healthcare setting. Health Plan knowledge preferred.
You have expertise in most of these technologies: Python, Postgres, Snowflake, DBT, Airflow, BigQuery, Data Governance, some experience with analytics, data science, ML collaboration tools such as Tableau, Mode, and Looker.




Pursuant to the San Francisco Fair Chance Ordinance, we will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records. We are an E-Verify company.




About Clover: We are reinventing health insurance by combining the power of data with human empathy to keep our members healthier. We believe the healthcare system is broken, so we've created custom software and analytics to empower our clinical staff to intervene and provide personalized care to the people who need it most.




We always put our members first, and our success as a team is measured by the quality of life of the people we serve. Those who work at Clover are passionate and mission-driven individuals with diverse areas of expertise, working together to solve the most complicated problem in the world: healthcare.




From Clover’s inception, Diversity & Inclusion have always been key to our success. We are an Equal Opportunity Employer and our employees are people with different strengths, experiences and backgrounds, who share a passion for improving people's lives. Diversity not only includes race and gender identity, but also age, disability status, veteran status, sexual orientation, religion and many other parts of one’s identity. All of our employee’s points of view are key to our success, and inclusion is everyone's responsibility.

What Makes Cloudflare Special?




We’re not just a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company. We’re a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company with a soul. Fundamental to our mission to help build a better Internet is protecting the free and open Internet.




Project Galileo : We equip politically and artistically important organizations and journalists with powerful tools to defend themselves against attacks that would otherwise censor their work, technology already used by Cloudflare’s enterprise customers--at no cost.




Athenian Project : We created Athenian Project to ensure that state and local governments have the highest level of protection and reliability for free, so that their constituents have access to election information and voter registration.




Path Forward Partnership : Since 2016, we have partnered with Path Forward, a nonprofit organization, to create 16-week positions for mid-career professionals who want to get back to the workplace after taking time off to care for a child, parent, or loved one.




1.1.1.1 : We released 1.1.1.1 to help fix the foundation of the Internet by building a faster, more secure and privacy-centric public DNS resolver. This is available publicly for everyone to use - it is the first consumer-focused service Cloudflare has ever released. Here’s the deal - we don’t store client IP addresses never, ever. We will continue to abide by our privacy commitment and ensure that no user data is sold to advertisers or used to target consumers.




Sound like something you’d like to be a part of? We’d love to hear from you!

Simply put, we're pushing insurance into the future, focusing on accuracy, speed, and ease.

The data needs to be store in an Azure Data Lake and eventually brought into a cloud-based data store such as Snowflake or a similar data store. Then, the Analytics reporting solution needs to be built either using cloud-based Google Looker or Microsoft Power BI or another similar tool.

Using the Cloud OTI Data Platform, the Senior Data Engineer will build highly available, robust, concrete data pipelines and reporting solutions following industry best practices, adhering to OTI security guidelines, modifying, and running automated CI/CD pipelines used for releasing code, and modifying and executing terraform modules for deploying infrastructure components, working collaboratively under the direction of OTI data engineering management and leads.

Nearly every time you make a purchase, physical or digital, there's an accompanying unique and nuanced tax compliance calculation.




The logic behind calculating taxes — the rules, rates, and boundaries — is a global, layered, three-dimensional mess of complexity, with compliance dictated by governments and applied by every business, every day.

That's a massive technical challenge, in terms of scale, reliability, and complexity, and we do it better than anyone.




That's why we're growing fast. Headquartered in Seattle, Avalara has offices across the U.S., Canada, Brazil, UK, Europe and India.

Who are we?




Kuali builds software solutions for higher education. We help our customers — colleges & universities — focus on providing a fantastic education to students by decreasing their administrative costs. We work in a competitive space, ripe for innovation, with users ready to be delighted.




Our Culture




As a company, we are guided by our cultural values:




Iterate to evolve
Cultivate openness
Act with accountability
Assume the best
Practice humility
Deliver amazing experiences

As Kuali engineers, we learn from and teach each other, we practice transparency and empathy, and we delight in delivering value to our customers.




We work remotely, and have for years. Distributed work is in our bones, with a history of institutions working across state lines on open-source software for more than ten years. Our employees each work in the environment where they’re happiest, from Pennsylvania to Hawaii. We work consciously to create a collaborative and healthy remote work culture, and we travel to meet in person a few times each year.




Everyone should love their work.




Kuali has been voted a top place to work for 5 years in a row by the Salt Lake Tribune. We also made Forbes' list of America's Best Startup Employers for 2020. Not too shabby.




Your product team




You will work closely with product, design, and our customers on the Kuali Financials product. Customers use our Financials product to efficiently and effectively manage the complex accounting needs of higher education.




Requirements

Who are you?




We’re looking for curious, enthusiastic, empathetic engineers to solve problems, execute on ideas, advocate for the customer, and contribute to a team culture built on trust and mutual respect. As a data engineer here, you’ll have a significant impact on what we do and how we do it.




We build and support data pipelines and reporting solutions for a range of business needs, including end user consumption. We are focusing heavily on greenfield development: you will build new analytics and data services including data pipelines, data warehousing solutions, ETL processes, end user reports, as well as the deployment mechanisms and the platform's environments. As a Data Engineer you will have the unique opportunity to influence major decisions from how our data platform's cloud-based infrastructure is architected, to what modern data-engineering frameworks and tooling are used, to how our CI/CD will operate. While building out the new platform, you will also maintain a light-weight, legacy solution, which will be deprecated and replaced. We believe that great developers can always learn new tools. Above any specific tech stack, we’re looking for versatile developers — those who know when to think big and when to act small, and who are comfortable in both greenfield and refactoring projects.




We believe the best products are created by teams who represent a broad range of ideas and perspectives. We value employees with diverse backgrounds and experiences.




You...




Have 3+ years of Data Engineering experience or equivalent.
Architecture-level experience conceptualizing and building infrastructure that processes, stores, and vends large data sets for analytics purposes at an enterprise scale in the cloud. Advanced SQL skills including database design best practices. CTEs, functions, stored procedures don't intimidate you.
Have hands-on experience with ETL-as-code frameworks such as Airflow, Luigi, or Prefect or experience building ETL processes/services from scratch with generic languages and libraries.
Experience developing and supporting reports with BI and reporting tools such as Tableau, Domo, Looker, or Sisense.
Understand the software development lifecycle and are able to work alongside development teams. You’re excited to collaborate closely with Application Engineers, Product Managers, and Customer Success and use real-time feedback to solve problems iteratively.
Are ready to help reformulate existing frameworks to improve and expand current offerings.
Aren’t afraid to get your hands dirty on devops work.




We'd be delighted if you bring experience with:




Shipping Software as a Service (SaaS) solutions
One or more of these technologies: Java, Python, Node.js, AWS
One or more relational databases: MySQL, Oracle or Postgres
One or more analytics databases: Redshift, Snowflake, or Teradata.
Report and dashboard requirements analysis and design
Front end development with React or Angular
The Higher Education community




Other things you should know:




This team is (and has always been) fully remote. You’d be expected to have a suitable home working environment or alternative. We try to get together in person as a team or company 2-4 times a year.




Benefits

Top-of-the-line equipment of your choice to get your job done
A truly exceptional benefits package including full premium coverage for employee and dependent medical and dental care
401(k) matching
Paid Maternity/Parental leave

If so, we would love to talk!

Bring your data skill and join a growing technology team and an awesome customer community.

Are you...

extremely proficient at moving, manipulating, and managing data in relational databases?
motivated by delighting customers and representing a team?
able to plan your day, track your work, and keep your promises?


Heuristic Solutions is looking for an extraordinary person to join our Implementation Team as a LearningBuilder Technical Analyst. Technical Analysts like to work with customers on requirements and wow them with the data. As an Analyst, you will use professional tools to manipulate data and achieve shared understanding.

LearningBuilder is a low-code credentialing management system that allows strong Analysts to go from being the person who “gets it” to becoming the person that “gets it and gets it done.” LearningBuilder customers include small certification and licensure boards as well as large and complex organizations and the federal government. If you love working with customers and data, to push an implementation to the finish line, this job is for you.

What You’ll Do

On a given day, a LearningBuilder Technical Analyst will complete any of the following tasks:

Evaluate client requirements for data migration and customer ad hoc projects;
Write SQL scripts, queries, and stored procedures to extract and import data;
Translate, merge, scrub and map data into conceptual, logical and physical data models;
Validate data migration and mappings;
Facilitate client reviews and update routines as needed;
Communicate project timelines internally and externally;
Develop complex reports using SQL, Microsoft Office and other utilities or languages as necessary;
Perform ad hoc and structured data analysis;
Identify data issues proactively and flag them to respective stakeholders;
Work with internal teams to ensure project continuity;
Leave breadcrumbs of your work using clear documentation;
Follow best practices to preserve the integrity, quality, and security of data at all times; and
Uses data to answer stakeholder questions as required.


What We’ll Accomplish Together

We are building a credentialing management system that is changing the way people think about certification, licensure, accreditation, and continuing competence. We are doing more than orchestrating a complex process. We give programs options they hadn’t thought of and ways to relate to their community to build relationship. People choose LearningBuilder because we help them build programs that show what a credentialing program can be. To be successful, we need to build a great product, a great team, and a great community of customers.

You will be a LearningBuilder implementer and a LearningBuilder customer. You will influence the direction of the product because you will know your clients' needs and you will know how best to meet them. You will provide clear guidance and requirements to help the Product team build the right product.

We will build a great Team by surrounding you with people who share your values and are harnessed to a common cause. You will bring your vision, skill, and drive to be part of something greater than yourself. You will do your “job” and you’ll always be thinking about how we could do something better. You’ll look around the field, find empty space, and go there to have an impact.

We will build a great community of customers together as you become a valued resource for your clients. Customers will refer their industry colleagues to you because of how transformative you have been for them. Customers will know you look out for their best interest and will provide unmatched guidance.

Not exactly what you are looking for?

Do you like what you see but you aren't quite sure if you meet all the technical requirements? Let us know! We are also looking for superstars to join our Support and Professional Services Teams. If you have a knack for technical things but don't want data to be your sole focus, consider applying as a Support Specialist or Analyst. These are good roles for people that are smart and balance customer and technical focus but don't have enough technical experience to lead a project. On the Professional Services Team, we are also hiring Implementation Analysts and Consultants. Analysts get to the fine details of what needs to get done and manage projects from start to finish. Consultants take the ""unsolved"" problems and turn them into masterpieces. Let us know what inspires you!

Requirements

Key indicators of success in this role are attention to detail, structured problem solving, documentation-first mindset, and commitment to continuous improvement. You will have proven teamwork and communication skills, passion for delighting the customer, and an awareness of when and how to ask for help when you need it.

Who You Are

Good Technical Analysts share some common characteristics:

You learn quickly. You take in information like a sponge. You get things before other people. You grasp what people are saying even if they aren’t saying it quite right. You internalize information quickly so you can reflect it back to your collaborators efficiently. You’re the one who sees the patterns and can help others see them, too..
You hunger for the “why”? You know that the more you understand the reasons behind decisions, the better you can help. You help others make decisions by helping them grapple with inconsistencies and details they hadn’t thought of.
You love data. Data speaks to you and tells a story. You read the story and adjust the ending as needed to get the desired result.
You are supremely well organized. You know what you have to accomplish and you give yourself the space to do things right. You know how to negotiate a new request with a smile so it gets done when it needs to get done. You rarely work late or on week-ends. You’ve set realistic expectations for when things will get done and given yourself buffer for the unexpected. People count on you to keep your promises.
You love working with people. You build relationships with people to get things done. You aren’t afraid to ask questions of senior people when you get stuck. You love helping more junior people think through how to do better. Clients know you will find a way to help. You know how to run meeting that makes good use of everyone’s time.
You are a life-long learner. You have sources and sites that guide you to be a better professional. You love to read and are always looking for how others are doing things better.

        ","About ONE

ONE is on a mission to help people live healthier financial lives. We’re doing this by creating simple solutions to help our customers save, spend, and grow their money – all in one place.

The U.S. consumer today deserves better. Millions of Americans today can’t access credit, build savings or wealth, and are left to manage their financial lives through multiple disconnected apps. Almost a quarter of U.S. adults are unbanked or underbanked and roughly 80% of fintech users rely on multiple accounts to manage their finances.

What makes us unique? We are backed by a preeminent fintech investor (Ribbit) and the world’s largest retailer (Walmart), maintain the speed and independence of a startup, and employ a strong (and growing) collection of world-class talent.

There’s never been a better moment to build a business that helps people live healthier financial lives. Come build with us!

The role

As an Engineer, Data, your mandate is to build the data transformation pipelines & reporting infrastructure that serve our members and run our company. This role will impact ONE’s vision by writing, reviewing, and shipping code and collaborating with others across the company. You will work closely across the Engineering, Product, Design as well as Sales, Compliance and Customer Support team(s) working with stakeholders as highly technical, communicative, and emotionally intelligent partners. This role reports to Manager, Data Engineering.

This role is responsible for:

Building and maintaining ONE's data infrastructure.
Developing and owning ONE's streaming data transformation pipeline.
Managing and supporting reporting and analytics tools.
Collaborating closely with our Data Analysts and Data Scientists.
Tracking and defining metrics around performance.
Additional duties as assigned by your manager.


You bring

Mid Career (5-10 Years)
Experience in Apache Spark, Scala, Python, SQL.
Experience designing and implementing low latency data pipelines using Spark structured streaming.
Experience optimizing SQL queries and lake / warehouse data structures.
Cost-conscience creative problem solving.
Proficient in AWS cloud services and technologies.
Experience building, shipping — and growing — non-trivial products & services.
Passion for your craft, people, and our mission. You value quality across code, communication, and culture.
A desire to keep growing your skills, and an ability to learn quickly. We hire for slope, not just y-intercept.


Pay Transparency

The estimated annual base salary for this position ranges from $175,000 to $190,000. Pay is generally based upon the level, complexity, responsibility, and job duties/requirements of the specific position. We then source candidates with the requisite skills, expertise, education, training, and experience. If you are selected for an interview, please feel welcome to speak to a Talent Partner about our compensation philosophy and other available benefits.

Leveling Philosophy

In order to thoughtfully scale the company and avoid downstream inequities, we’ve adopted a flat titling structure at ONE. Though we may occasionally post a role externally with a prefix such as “Senior” to reflect the external level of the position, we do not use prefixes in titles like that internally unless in a position which manages a team. Internal titles typically include your specific functional responsibility, such as engineering, product management or sales, and often include additional descriptors to ensure clarity of role and placement within our organization (i.e. “Engineer, Platform”, “Sales, Business Development” or “Manager, Talent”). Employees are paid commensurate with their experience and the internal level within ONE.

What it's like working @ ONE

Our teams collaborate remotely and in our work spaces in New York and Sacramento.

Competitive cash
Benefits effective on day one
Early access to a high potential, high growth fintech
Generous stock option packages in an early-stage startup
Remote friendly (anywhere in the US) and office friendly - you pick the schedule
Flexible time off programs - vacation, sick, paid parental leave, and paid caregiver leave
401(k) plan with match


Inclusion & Belonging

To build technology and products that are used and loved by people and solve real-world problems, we need to build a team with many different perspectives and experiences. We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status. We encourage candidates from all backgrounds to apply. Applicants in need of special assistance or accommodation during the interview process or in accessing our website may contact us.

ONE is on a mission to help people live healthier financial lives. We’re doing this by creating simple solutions to help our customers save, spend, and grow their money – all in one place.

What makes us unique? We are backed by a preeminent fintech investor (Ribbit) and the world’s largest retailer (Walmart), maintain the speed and independence of a startup, and employ a strong (and growing) collection of world-class talent.

There’s never been a better moment to build a business that helps people live healthier financial lives. Come build with us!

Pay Transparency

The estimated annual base salary for this position ranges from $175,000 to $190,000. Pay is generally based upon the level, complexity, responsibility, and job duties/requirements of the specific position. We then source candidates with the requisite skills, expertise, education, training, and experience. If you are selected for an interview, please feel welcome to speak to a Talent Partner about our compensation philosophy and other available benefits.

Leveling Philosophy

In order to thoughtfully scale the company and avoid downstream inequities, we’ve adopted a flat titling structure at ONE. Though we may occasionally post a role externally with a prefix such as “Senior” to reflect the external level of the position, we do not use prefixes in titles like that internally unless in a position which manages a team. Internal titles typically include your specific functional responsibility, such as engineering, product management or sales, and often include additional descriptors to ensure clarity of role and placement within our organization (i.e. “Engineer, Platform”, “Sales, Business Development” or “Manager, Talent”). Employees are paid commensurate with their experience and the internal level within ONE.

What it's like working @ ONE

Our teams collaborate remotely and in our work spaces in New York and Sacramento.

Benefits effective on day one

Inclusion & Belonging

To build technology and products that are used and loved by people and solve real-world problems, we need to build a team with many different perspectives and experiences. We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.

        ","About ONE

ONE is on a mission to help people live healthier financial lives. We’re doing this by creating simple solutions to help our customers save, spend, and grow their money – all in one place.

The U.S. consumer today deserves better. Millions of Americans today can’t access credit, build savings or wealth, and are left to manage their financial lives through multiple disconnected apps. Almost a quarter of U.S. adults are unbanked or underbanked and roughly 80% of fintech users rely on multiple accounts to manage their finances.

What makes us unique? We are backed by a preeminent fintech investor (Ribbit) and the world’s largest retailer (Walmart), maintain the speed and independence of a startup, and employ a strong (and growing) collection of world-class talent.

There’s never been a better moment to build a business that helps people live healthier financial lives. Come build with us!

As an Engineer, Data, your mandate is to build the data transformation pipelines & reporting infrastructure that serve our members and run our company. This role will impact ONE’s vision by writing, reviewing, and shipping code and collaborating with others across the company.

Experience building, shipping — and growing — non-trivial products & services.
Passion for your craft, people, and our mission. You value quality across code, communication, and culture.

If you are selected for an interview, please feel welcome to speak to a Talent Partner about our compensation philosophy and other available benefits.

Leveling Philosophy

In order to thoughtfully scale the company and avoid downstream inequities, we’ve adopted a flat titling structure at ONE. Though we may occasionally post a role externally with a prefix such as “Senior” to reflect the external level of the position, we do not use prefixes in titles like that internally unless in a position which manages a team. Internal titles typically include your specific functional responsibility, such as engineering, product management or sales, and often include additional descriptors to ensure clarity of role and placement within our organization (i.e. “Engineer, Platform”, “Sales, Business Development” or “Manager, Talent”). Employees are paid commensurate with their experience and the internal level within ONE.

Inclusion & Belonging

To build technology and products that are used and loved by people and solve real-world problems, we need to build a team with many different perspectives and experiences.

We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.

        ","About ONE

ONE is on a mission to help people live healthier financial lives. We’re doing this by creating simple solutions to help our customers save, spend, and grow their money – all in one place.

The U.S. consumer today deserves better. Millions of Americans today can’t access credit, build savings or wealth, and are left to manage their financial lives through multiple disconnected apps. Almost a quarter of U.S. adults are unbanked or underbanked and roughly 80% of fintech users rely on multiple accounts to manage their finances.

What makes us unique? We are backed by a preeminent fintech investor (Ribbit) and the world’s largest retailer (Walmart), maintain the speed and independence of a startup, and employ a strong (and growing) collection of world-class talent.

There’s never been a better moment to build a business that helps people live healthier financial lives. Come build with us!

The role

As an Engineer, Data, your mandate is to build the data transformation pipelines & reporting infrastructure that serve our members and run our company. This role will impact ONE’s vision by writing, reviewing, and shipping code and collaborating with others across the company. You will work closely across the Engineering, Product, Design as well as Sales, Compliance and Customer Support team(s) working with stakeholders as highly technical, communicative, and emotionally intelligent partners. This role reports to Manager, Data Engineering.

This role is responsible for:

Building and maintaining ONE's data infrastructure.
Developing and owning ONE's streaming data transformation pipeline.
Managing and supporting reporting and analytics tools.
Collaborating closely with our Data Analysts and Data Scientists.
Tracking and defining metrics around performance.
Additional duties as assigned by your manager.


You bring

Mid Career (5-10 Years)
Experience in Apache Spark, Scala, Python, SQL.
Experience designing and implementing low latency data pipelines using Spark structured streaming.
Experience optimizing SQL queries and lake / warehouse data structures.
Cost-conscience creative problem solving.
Proficient in AWS cloud services and technologies.
Experience building, shipping — and growing — non-trivial products & services.
Passion for your craft, people, and our mission. You value quality across code, communication, and culture.
A desire to keep growing your skills, and an ability to learn quickly. We hire for slope, not just y-intercept.


Pay Transparency

The estimated annual base salary for this position ranges from $175,000 to $190,000. Pay is generally based upon the level, complexity, responsibility, and job duties/requirements of the specific position. We then source candidates with the requisite skills, expertise, education, training, and experience. If you are selected for an interview, please feel welcome to speak to a Talent Partner about our compensation philosophy and other available benefits.

Leveling Philosophy

In order to thoughtfully scale the company and avoid downstream inequities, we’ve adopted a flat titling structure at ONE. Though we may occasionally post a role externally with a prefix such as “Senior” to reflect the external level of the position, we do not use prefixes in titles like that internally unless in a position which manages a team. Internal titles typically include your specific functional responsibility, such as engineering, product management or sales, and often include additional descriptors to ensure clarity of role and placement within our organization (i.e. “Engineer, Platform”, “Sales, Business Development” or “Manager, Talent”). Employees are paid commensurate with their experience and the internal level within ONE.

What it's like working @ ONE

Our teams collaborate remotely and in our work spaces in New York and Sacramento.

Competitive cash
Benefits effective on day one
Early access to a high potential, high growth fintech
Generous stock option packages in an early-stage startup
Remote friendly (anywhere in the US) and office friendly - you pick the schedule
Flexible time off programs - vacation, sick, paid parental leave, and paid caregiver leave
401(k) plan with match


Inclusion & Belonging

To build technology and products that are used and loved by people and solve real-world problems, we need to build a team with many different perspectives and experiences. We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status. We encourage candidates from all backgrounds to apply. Applicants in need of special assistance or accommodation during the interview process or in accessing our website may contact us.

        ","About ONE

ONE is on a mission to help people live healthier financial lives. We’re doing this by creating simple solutions to help our customers save, spend, and grow their money – all in one place.

The U.S. consumer today deserves better. Millions of Americans today can’t access credit, build savings or wealth, and are left to manage their financial lives through multiple disconnected apps. Almost a quarter of U.S. adults are unbanked or underbanked and roughly 80% of fintech users rely on multiple accounts to manage their finances.

What makes us unique? We are backed by a preeminent fintech investor (Ribbit) and the world’s largest retailer (Walmart), maintain the speed and independence of a startup, and employ a strong (and growing) collection of world-class talent.

There’s never been a better moment to build a business that helps people live healthier financial lives. Come build with us!

The role

As an Engineer, Data, your mandate is to build the data transformation pipelines & reporting infrastructure that serve our members and run our company. This role will impact ONE’s vision by writing, reviewing, and shipping code and collaborating with others across the company. You will work closely across the Engineering, Product, Design as well as Sales, Compliance and Customer Support team(s) working with stakeholders as highly technical, communicative, and emotionally intelligent partners. This role reports to Manager, Data Engineering.

This role is responsible for:

Building and maintaining ONE's data infrastructure.
Developing and owning ONE's streaming data transformation pipeline.
Managing and supporting reporting and analytics tools.
Collaborating closely with our Data Analysts and Data Scientists.
Tracking and defining metrics around performance.
Additional duties as assigned by your manager.


You bring

Experience optimizing SQL queries and lake / warehouse data structures.
Cost-conscience creative problem solving.
Proficient in AWS cloud services and technologies.
Experience building, shipping — and growing — non-trivial products & services.
Passion for your craft, people, and our mission. You value quality across code, communication, and culture.
A desire to keep growing your skills, and an ability to learn quickly. We hire for slope, not just y-intercept.


Pay Transparency

The estimated annual base salary for this position ranges from $175,000 to $190,000. Pay is generally based upon the level, complexity, responsibility, and job duties/requirements of the specific position. We then source candidates with the requisite skills, expertise, education, training, and experience. If you are selected for an interview, please feel welcome to speak to a Talent Partner about our compensation philosophy and other available benefits.

Leveling Philosophy

In order to thoughtfully scale the company and avoid downstream inequities, we’ve adopted a flat titling structure at ONE. Though we may occasionally post a role externally with a prefix such as “Senior” to reflect the external level of the position, we do not use prefixes in titles like that internally unless in a position which manages a team. Internal titles typically include your specific functional responsibility, such as engineering, product management or sales, and often include additional descriptors to ensure clarity of role and placement within our organization (i.e. “Engineer, Platform”, “Sales, Business Development” or “Manager, Talent”). Employees are paid commensurate with their experience and the internal level within ONE.

What it's like working @ ONE

Our teams collaborate remotely and in our work spaces in New York and Sacramento.

Inclusion & Belonging

To build technology and products that are used and loved by people and solve real-world problems, we need to build a team with many different perspectives and experiences. We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status. We encourage candidates from all backgrounds to apply. Applicants in need of special assistance or accommodation during the interview process or in accessing our website may contact us.

        ","About ONE

ONE is on a mission to help people live healthier financial lives. We’re doing this by creating simple solutions to help our customers save, spend, and grow their money – all in one place.

The U.S. consumer today deserves better. Millions of Americans today can’t access credit, build savings or wealth, and are left to manage their financial lives through multiple disconnected apps. Almost a quarter of U.S. adults are unbanked or underbanked and roughly 80% of fintech users rely on multiple accounts to manage their finances.

What makes us unique? We are backed by a preeminent fintech investor (Ribbit) and the world’s largest retailer (Walmart), maintain the speed and independence of a startup, and employ a strong (and growing) collection of world-class talent.

There’s never been a better moment to build a business that helps people live healthier financial lives. Come build with us!

The role

As an Engineer, Data, your mandate is to build the data transformation pipelines & reporting infrastructure that serve our members and run our company. This role will impact ONE’s vision by writing, reviewing, and shipping code and collaborating with others across the company. You will work closely across the Engineering, Product, Design as well as Sales, Compliance and Customer Support team(s) working with stakeholders as highly technical, communicative, and emotionally intelligent partners. This role reports to Manager, Data Engineering.

This role is responsible for:

Building and maintaining ONE's data infrastructure.
Developing and owning ONE's streaming data transformation pipeline.
Managing and supporting reporting and analytics tools.
Collaborating closely with our Data Analysts and Data Scientists.
Tracking and defining metrics around performance.
Additional duties as assigned by your manager.


You bring

Mid Career (5-10 Years)
Experience in Apache Spark, Scala, Python, SQL.
Experience designing and implementing low latency data pipelines using Spark structured streaming.
Experience optimizing SQL queries and lake / warehouse data structures.
Cost-conscience creative problem solving.
Proficient in AWS cloud services and technologies.
Experience building, shipping — and growing — non-trivial products & services.
Passion for your craft, people, and our mission. You value quality across code, communication, and culture.
A desire to keep growing your skills, and an ability to learn quickly. We hire for slope, not just y-intercept.


Pay Transparency

The estimated annual base salary for this position ranges from $175,000 to $190,000. Pay is generally based upon the level, complexity, responsibility, and job duties/requirements of the specific position. We then source candidates with the requisite skills, expertise, education, training, and experience. If you are selected for an interview, please feel welcome to speak to a Talent Partner about our compensation philosophy and other available benefits.

Leveling Philosophy

In order to thoughtfully scale the company and avoid downstream inequities, we’ve adopted a flat titling structure at ONE. Though we may occasionally post a role externally with a prefix such as “Senior” to reflect the external level of the position, we do not use prefixes in titles like that internally unless in a position which manages a team. Internal titles typically include your specific functional responsibility, such as engineering, product management or sales, and often include additional descriptors to ensure clarity of role and placement within our organization (i.e. “Engineer, Platform”, “Sales, Business Development” or “Manager, Talent”). Employees are paid commensurate with their experience and the internal level within ONE.

What it's like working @ ONE

Our teams collaborate remotely and in our work spaces in New York and Sacramento.

Inclusion & Belonging

To build technology and products that are used and loved by people and solve real-world problems, we need to build a team with many different perspectives and experiences. We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status. We encourage candidates from all backgrounds to apply. Applicants in need of special assistance or accommodation during the interview process or in accessing our website may contact us.

        ","About ONE

ONE is on a mission to help people live healthier financial lives. We’re doing this by creating simple solutions to help our customers save, spend, and grow their money – all in one place.

The U.S. consumer today deserves better. Millions of Americans today can’t access credit, build savings or wealth, and are left to manage their financial lives through multiple disconnected apps. Almost a quarter of U.S. adults are unbanked or underbanked and roughly 80% of fintech users rely on multiple accounts to manage their finances.

What makes us unique? We are backed by a preeminent fintech investor (Ribbit) and the world’s largest retailer (Walmart), maintain the speed and independence of a startup, and employ a strong (and growing) collection of world-class talent.

There’s never been a better moment to build a business that helps people live healthier financial lives. Come build with us!

The role

As an Engineer, Data, your mandate is to build the data transformation pipelines & reporting infrastructure that serve our members and run our company. This role will impact ONE’s vision by writing, reviewing, and shipping code and collaborating with others across the company. You will work closely across the Engineering, Product, Design as well as Sales, Compliance and Customer Support team(s) working with stakeholders as highly technical, communicative, and emotionally intelligent partners. This role reports to Manager, Data Engineering.

This role is responsible for:

Building and maintaining ONE's data infrastructure.
Developing and owning ONE's streaming data transformation pipeline.
Managing and supporting reporting and analytics tools.
Collaborating closely with our Data Analysts and Data Scientists.
Tracking and defining metrics around performance.
Additional duties as assigned by your manager.


You bring

Mid Career (5-10 Years)
Experience in Apache Spark, Scala, Python, SQL.
Experience designing and implementing low latency data pipelines using Spark structured streaming.
Experience optimizing SQL queries and lake / warehouse data structures.
Cost-conscience creative problem solving.
Proficient in AWS cloud services and technologies.
Experience building, shipping — and growing — non-trivial products & services.
Passion for your craft, people, and our mission. You value quality across code, communication, and culture.
A desire to keep growing your skills, and an ability to learn quickly. We hire for slope, not just y-intercept.


Pay Transparency

The estimated annual base salary for this position ranges from $175,000 to $190,000. Pay is generally based upon the level, complexity, responsibility, and job duties/requirements of the specific position. We then source candidates with the requisite skills, expertise, education, training, and experience. If you are selected for an interview, please feel welcome to speak to a Talent Partner about our compensation philosophy and other available benefits.

Leveling Philosophy

In order to thoughtfully scale the company and avoid downstream inequities, we’ve adopted a flat titling structure at ONE. Though we may occasionally post a role externally with a prefix such as “Senior” to reflect the external level of the position, we do not use prefixes in titles like that internally unless in a position which manages a team. Internal titles typically include your specific functional responsibility, such as engineering, product management or sales, and often include additional descriptors to ensure clarity of role and placement within our organization (i.e. “Engineer, Platform”, “Sales, Business Development” or “Manager, Talent”). Employees are paid commensurate with their experience and the internal level within ONE.

What it's like working @ ONE

Our teams collaborate remotely and in our work spaces in New York and Sacramento.

Competitive cash
Benefits effective on day one
Early access to a high potential, high growth fintech
Generous stock option packages in an early-stage startup
Remote friendly (anywhere in the US) and office friendly - you pick the schedule
Flexible time off programs - vacation, sick, paid parental leave, and paid caregiver leave
401(k) plan with match


Inclusion & Belonging

To build technology and products that are used and loved by people and solve real-world problems, we need to build a team with many different perspectives and experiences. We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status. We encourage candidates from all backgrounds to apply. Applicants in need of special assistance or accommodation during the interview process or in accessing our website may contact us.

        ","About ONE

ONE is on a mission to help people live healthier financial lives. We’re doing this by creating simple solutions to help our customers save, spend, and grow their money – all in one place.

The U.S. consumer today deserves better. Millions of Americans today can’t access credit, build savings or wealth, and are left to manage their financial lives through multiple disconnected apps. Almost a quarter of U.S. adults are unbanked or underbanked and roughly 80% of fintech users rely on multiple accounts to manage their finances.

What makes us unique? We are backed by a preeminent fintech investor (Ribbit) and the world’s largest retailer (Walmart), maintain the speed and independence of a startup, and employ a strong (and growing) collection of world-class talent.

There’s never been a better moment to build a business that helps people live healthier financial lives. Come build with us!

The role

As an Engineer, Data, your mandate is to build the data transformation pipelines & reporting infrastructure that serve our members and run our company. This role will impact ONE’s vision by writing, reviewing, and shipping code and collaborating with others across the company. You will work closely across the Engineering, Product, Design as well as Sales, Compliance and Customer Support team(s) working with stakeholders as highly technical, communicative, and emotionally intelligent partners. This role reports to Manager, Data Engineering.

This role is responsible for:

Building and maintaining ONE's data infrastructure.
Developing and owning ONE's streaming data transformation pipeline.
Managing and supporting reporting and analytics tools.
Collaborating closely with our Data Analysts and Data Scientists.
Tracking and defining metrics around performance.
Additional duties as assigned by your manager.


You bring

Mid Career (5-10 Years)
Experience in Apache Spark, Scala, Python, SQL.
Experience designing and implementing low latency data pipelines using Spark structured streaming.
Experience optimizing SQL queries and lake / warehouse data structures.
Cost-conscience creative problem solving.
Proficient in AWS cloud services and technologies.
Experience building, shipping — and growing — non-trivial products & services.
Passion for your craft, people, and our mission. You value quality across code, communication, and culture.
A desire to keep growing your skills, and an ability to learn quickly. We hire for slope, not just y-intercept.


Pay Transparency

The estimated annual base salary for this position ranges from $175,000 to $190,000. Pay is generally based upon the level, complexity, responsibility, and job duties/requirements of the specific position. We then source candidates with the requisite skills, expertise, education, training, and experience. If you are selected for an interview, please feel welcome to speak to a Talent Partner about our compensation philosophy and other available benefits.

Leveling Philosophy

In order to thoughtfully scale the company and avoid downstream inequities, we’ve adopted a flat titling structure at ONE. Though we may occasionally post a role externally with a prefix such as “Senior” to reflect the external level of the position, we do not use prefixes in titles like that internally unless in a position which manages a team. Internal titles typically include your specific functional responsibility, such as engineering, product management or sales, and often include additional descriptors to ensure clarity of role and placement within our organization (i.e. “Engineer, Platform”, “Sales, Business Development” or “Manager, Talent”). Employees are paid commensurate with their experience and the internal level within ONE.

What it's like working @ ONE

Our teams collaborate remotely and in our work spaces in New York and Sacramento.

Competitive cash
Benefits effective on day one
Early access to a high potential, high growth fintech
Generous stock option packages in an early-stage startup
Remote friendly (anywhere in the US) and office friendly - you pick the schedule
Flexible time off programs - vacation, sick, paid parental leave, and paid caregiver leave
401(k) plan with match


Inclusion & Belonging

To build technology and products that are used and loved by people and solve real-world problems, we need to build a team with many different perspectives and experiences. We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status. We encourage candidates from all backgrounds to apply. Applicants in need of special assistance or accommodation during the interview process or in accessing our website may contact us.

        ","About ONE

ONE is on a mission to help people live healthier financial lives. We’re doing this by creating simple solutions to help our customers save, spend, and grow their money – all in one place.

The U.S. consumer today deserves better. Millions of Americans today can’t access credit, build savings or wealth, and are left to manage their financial lives through multiple disconnected apps. Almost a quarter of U.S. adults are unbanked or underbanked and roughly 80% of fintech users rely on multiple accounts to manage their finances.

What makes us unique? We are backed by a preeminent fintech investor (Ribbit) and the world’s largest retailer (Walmart), maintain the speed and independence of a startup, and employ a strong (and growing) collection of world-class talent.

There’s never been a better moment to build a business that helps people live healthier financial lives. Come build with us!

The role

As an Engineer, Data, your mandate is to build the data transformation pipelines & reporting infrastructure that serve our members and run our company. This role will impact ONE’s vision by writing, reviewing, and shipping code and collaborating with others across the company. You will work closely across the Engineering, Product, Design as well as Sales, Compliance and Customer Support team(s) working with stakeholders as highly technical, communicative, and emotionally intelligent partners. This role reports to Manager, Data Engineering.

This role is responsible for:

Building and maintaining ONE's data infrastructure.
Developing and owning ONE's streaming data transformation pipeline.
Managing and supporting reporting and analytics tools.
Collaborating closely with our Data Analysts and Data Scientists.
Tracking and defining metrics around performance.
Additional duties as assigned by your manager.


You bring

Mid Career (5-10 Years)
Experience in Apache Spark, Scala, Python, SQL.
Experience designing and implementing low latency data pipelines using Spark structured streaming.
Experience optimizing SQL queries and lake / warehouse data structures.
Cost-conscience creative problem solving.
Proficient in AWS cloud services and technologies.
Experience building, shipping — and growing — non-trivial products & services.
Passion for your craft, people, and our mission. You value quality across code, communication, and culture.
A desire to keep growing your skills, and an ability to learn quickly. We hire for slope, not just y-intercept.


Pay Transparency

The estimated annual base salary for this position ranges from $175,000 to $190,000. Pay is generally based upon the level, complexity, responsibility, and job duties/requirements of the specific position. We then source candidates with the requisite skills, expertise, education, training, and experience. If you are selected for an interview, please feel welcome to speak to a Talent Partner about our compensation philosophy and other available benefits.

Leveling Philosophy

In order to thoughtfully scale the company and avoid downstream inequities, we’ve adopted a flat titling structure at ONE. Though we may occasionally post a role externally with a prefix such as “Senior” to reflect the external level of the position, we do not use prefixes in titles like that internally unless in a position which manages a team. Internal titles typically include your specific functional responsibility, such as engineering, product management or sales, and often include additional descriptors to ensure clarity of role and placement within our organization (i.e. “Engineer, Platform”, “Sales, Business Development” or “Manager, Talent”). Employees are paid commensurate with their experience and the internal level within ONE.

What it's like working @ ONE

Our teams collaborate remotely and in our work spaces in New York and Sacramento.

Competitive cash
Benefits effective on day one
Early access to a high potential, high growth fintech
Generous stock option packages in an early-stage startup
Remote friendly (anywhere in the US) and office friendly - you pick the schedule
Flexible time off programs - vacation, sick, paid parental leave, and paid caregiver leave
401(k) plan with match


Inclusion & Belonging

To build technology and products that are used and loved by people and solve real-world problems, we need to build a team with many different perspectives and experiences. We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status. We encourage candidates from all backgrounds to apply. Applicants in need of special assistance or accommodation during the interview process or in accessing our website may contact us. Email talent@one.app with any questions.","

        ","About ONE

ONE is on a mission to help people live healthier financial lives. We’re doing this by creating simple solutions to help our customers save, spend, and grow their money – all in one place.

The U.S. consumer today deserves better. Millions of Americans today can’t access credit, build savings or wealth, and are left to manage their financial lives through multiple disconnected apps. Almost a quarter of U.S. adults are unbanked or underbanked and roughly 80% of fintech users rely on multiple accounts to manage their finances.

What makes us unique? We are backed by a preeminent fintech investor (Ribbit) and the world’s largest retailer (Walmart), maintain the speed and independence of a startup, and employ a strong (and growing) collection of world-class talent.

There’s never been a better moment to build a business that helps people live healthier financial lives. Come build with us!

The role

As an Engineer, Data, your mandate is to build the data transformation pipelines & reporting infrastructure that serve our members and run our company. This role will impact ONE’s vision by writing, reviewing, and shipping code and collaborating with others across the company. You will work closely across the Engineering, Product, Design as well as Sales, Compliance and Customer Support team(s) working with stakeholders as highly technical, communicative, and emotionally intelligent partners. This role reports to Manager, Data Engineering.

This role is responsible for:

Building and maintaining ONE's data infrastructure.
Developing and owning ONE's streaming data transformation pipeline.
Managing and supporting reporting and analytics tools.
Collaborating closely with our Data Analysts and Data Scientists.
Tracking and defining metrics around performance.
Additional duties as assigned by your manager.


You bring

Mid Career (5-10 Years)
Experience in Apache Spark, Scala, Python, SQL.
Experience designing and implementing low latency data pipelines using Spark structured streaming.
Experience optimizing SQL queries and lake / warehouse data structures.
Cost-conscience creative problem solving.
Proficient in AWS cloud services and technologies.
Experience building, shipping — and growing — non-trivial products & services.
Passion for your craft, people, and our mission. You value quality across code, communication, and culture.
A desire to keep growing your skills, and an ability to learn quickly. We hire for slope, not just y-intercept.


Pay Transparency

The estimated annual base salary for this position ranges from $175,000 to $190,000. Pay is generally based upon the level, complexity, responsibility, and job duties/requirements of the specific position. We then source candidates with the requisite skills, expertise, education, training, and experience. If you are selected for an interview, please feel welcome to speak to a Talent Partner about our compensation philosophy and other available benefits.

Leveling Philosophy

In order to thoughtfully scale the company and avoid downstream inequities, we’ve adopted a flat titling structure at ONE. Though we may occasionally post a role externally with a prefix such as “Senior” to reflect the external level of the position, we do not use prefixes in titles like that internally unless in a position which manages a team. Internal titles typically include your specific functional responsibility, such as engineering, product management or sales, and often include additional descriptors to ensure clarity of role and placement within our organization (i.e. “Engineer, Platform”, “Sales, Business Development” or “Manager, Talent”). Employees are paid commensurate with their experience and the internal level within ONE.

What it's like working @ ONE

Our teams collaborate remotely and in our work spaces in New York and Sacramento.

Competitive cash
Benefits effective on day one
Early access to a high potential, high growth fintech
Generous stock option packages in an early-stage startup
Remote friendly (anywhere in the US) and office friendly - you pick the schedule
Flexible time off programs - vacation, sick, paid parental leave, and paid caregiver leave
401(k) plan with match


Inclusion & Belonging

To build technology and products that are used and loved by people and solve real-world problems, we need to build a team with many different perspectives and experiences. We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status. We encourage candidates from all backgrounds to apply. Applicants in need of special assistance or accommodation during the interview process or in accessing our website may contact us.

ONE is on a mission to help people live healthier financial lives. We’re doing this by creating simple solutions to help our customers save, spend, and grow their money – all in one place.

The U.S. consumer today deserves better. Millions of Americans today can’t access credit, build savings or wealth, and are left to manage their financial lives through multiple disconnected apps. Almost a quarter of U.S. adults are unbanked or underbanked and roughly 80% of fintech users rely on multiple accounts to manage their finances.

What makes us unique? We are backed by a preeminent fintech investor (Ribbit) and the world’s largest retailer (Walmart), maintain the speed and independence of a startup, and employ a strong (and growing) collection of world-class talent.

There’s never been a better moment to build a business that helps people live healthier financial lives. Come build with us!

Leveling Philosophy

In order to thoughtfully scale the company and avoid downstream inequities, we’ve adopted a flat titling structure at ONE.

        ","About ONE

ONE is on a mission to help people live healthier financial lives. We’re doing this by creating simple solutions to help our customers save, spend, and grow their money – all in one place.

The U.S. consumer today deserves better. Millions of Americans today can’t access credit, build savings or wealth, and are left to manage their financial lives through multiple disconnected apps. Almost a quarter of U.S. adults are unbanked or underbanked and roughly 80% of fintech users rely on multiple accounts to manage their finances.

What makes us unique? We are backed by a preeminent fintech investor (Ribbit) and the world’s largest retailer (Walmart), maintain the speed and independence of a startup, and employ a strong (and growing) collection of world-class talent.

There’s never been a better moment to build a business that helps people live healthier financial lives. Come build with us!

The role

As an Engineer, Data, your mandate is to build the data transformation pipelines & reporting infrastructure that serve our members and run our company. This role will impact ONE’s vision by writing, reviewing, and shipping code and collaborating with others across the company. You will work closely across the Engineering, Product, Design as well as Sales, Compliance and Customer Support team(s) working with stakeholders as highly technical, communicative, and emotionally intelligent partners. This role reports to Manager, Data Engineering.

This role is responsible for:

Building and maintaining ONE's data infrastructure.
Developing and owning ONE's streaming data transformation pipeline.
Managing and supporting reporting and analytics tools.
Collaborating closely with our Data Analysts and Data Scientists.
Tracking and defining metrics around performance.
Additional duties as assigned by your manager.


You bring

Mid Career (5-10 Years)
Experience in Apache Spark, Scala, Python, SQL.
Experience designing and implementing low latency data pipelines using Spark structured streaming.
Experience optimizing SQL queries and lake / warehouse data structures.
Cost-conscience creative problem solving.
Proficient in AWS cloud services and technologies.
Experience building, shipping — and growing — non-trivial products & services.
Passion for your craft, people, and our mission. You value quality across code, communication, and culture.
A desire to keep growing your skills, and an ability to learn quickly. We hire for slope, not just y-intercept.


Pay Transparency

The estimated annual base salary for this position ranges from $175,000 to $190,000. Pay is generally based upon the level, complexity, responsibility, and job duties/requirements of the specific position. We then source candidates with the requisite skills, expertise, education, training, and experience. If you are selected for an interview, please feel welcome to speak to a Talent Partner about our compensation philosophy and other available benefits.

Leveling Philosophy

In order to thoughtfully scale the company and avoid downstream inequities, we’ve adopted a flat titling structure at ONE. Though we may occasionally post a role externally with a prefix such as “Senior” to reflect the external level of the position, we do not use prefixes in titles like that internally unless in a position which manages a team. Internal titles typically include your specific functional responsibility, such as engineering, product management or sales, and often include additional descriptors to ensure clarity of role and placement within our organization (i.e. “Engineer, Platform”, “Sales, Business Development” or “Manager, Talent”). Employees are paid commensurate with their experience and the internal level within ONE.

What it's like working @ ONE

Our teams collaborate remotely and in our work spaces in New York and Sacramento.

Competitive cash
Benefits effective on day one
Early access to a high potential, high growth fintech
Generous stock option packages in an early-stage startup
Remote friendly (anywhere in the US) and office friendly - you pick the schedule
Flexible time off programs - vacation, sick, paid parental leave, and paid caregiver leave
401(k) plan with match


Inclusion & Belonging

To build technology and products that are used and loved by people and solve real-world problems, we need to build a team with many different perspectives and experiences. We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status. We encourage candidates from all backgrounds to apply. Applicants in need of special assistance or accommodation during the interview process or in accessing our website may contact us.

        ","About ONE

ONE is on a mission to help people live healthier financial lives. We’re doing this by creating simple solutions to help our customers save, spend, and grow their money – all in one place.

The U.S. consumer today deserves better. Millions of Americans today can’t access credit, build savings or wealth, and are left to manage their financial lives through multiple disconnected apps. Almost a quarter of U.S. adults are unbanked or underbanked and roughly 80% of fintech users rely on multiple accounts to manage their finances.

What makes us unique? We are backed by a preeminent fintech investor (Ribbit) and the world’s largest retailer (Walmart), maintain the speed and independence of a startup, and employ a strong (and growing) collection of world-class talent.

There’s never been a better moment to build a business that helps people live healthier financial lives. Come build with us!

The role

As an Engineer, Data, your mandate is to build the data transformation pipelines & reporting infrastructure that serve our members and run our company. This role will impact ONE’s vision by writing, reviewing, and shipping code and collaborating with others across the company. You will work closely across the Engineering, Product, Design as well as Sales, Compliance and Customer Support team(s) working with stakeholders as highly technical, communicative, and emotionally intelligent partners. This role reports to Manager, Data Engineering.

Building and maintaining ONE's data infrastructure.
Developing and owning ONE's streaming data transformation pipeline.
Managing and supporting reporting and analytics tools.
Collaborating closely with our Data Analysts and Data Scientists.

Passion for your craft, people, and our mission. You value quality across code, communication, and culture.

Pay Transparency

The estimated annual base salary for this position ranges from $175,000 to $190,000.

If you are selected for an interview, please feel welcome to speak to a Talent Partner about our compensation philosophy and other available benefits.

Leveling Philosophy

In order to thoughtfully scale the company and avoid downstream inequities, we’ve adopted a flat titling structure at ONE. Though we may occasionally post a role externally with a prefix such as “Senior” to reflect the external level of the position, we do not use prefixes in titles like that internally unless in a position which manages a team. Internal titles typically include your specific functional responsibility, such as engineering, product management or sales, and often include additional descriptors to ensure clarity of role and placement within our organization (i.e. “Engineer, Platform”, “Sales, Business Development” or “Manager, Talent”). Employees are paid commensurate with their experience and the internal level within ONE.

What it's like working @ ONE

Our teams collaborate remotely and in our work spaces in New York and Sacramento.

Inclusion & Belonging

To build technology and products that are used and loved by people and solve real-world problems, we need to build a team with many different perspectives and experiences. We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status. We encourage candidates from all backgrounds to apply. Applicants in need of special assistance or accommodation during the interview process or in accessing our website may contact us.

2. We want you to be you. Too often, companies tell you about their culture and then expect you to fit it. Our culture is built from the people who work here. We want you to feel safe to be who you are, take risks, and show us what you’ve got.

3. It’s your world. We know you have a life. We want to be part of it, but not all of it. At Alludo, we’re serious about empowering people to work when, how, and where they want. Couch? Sweatpants? Cool with us. We believe that happy employees mean happy customers. That’s why we hire amazing people and get out of their way.

        ","About ONE

ONE is on a mission to help people live healthier financial lives. We’re doing this by creating simple solutions to help our customers save, spend, and grow their money – all in one place.

The U.S. consumer today deserves better. Millions of Americans today can’t access credit, build savings or wealth, and are left to manage their financial lives through multiple disconnected apps. Almost a quarter of U.S. adults are unbanked or underbanked and roughly 80% of fintech users rely on multiple accounts to manage their finances.

What makes us unique? We are backed by a preeminent fintech investor (Ribbit) and the world’s largest retailer (Walmart), maintain the speed and independence of a startup, and employ a strong (and growing) collection of world-class talent.

There’s never been a better moment to build a business that helps people live healthier financial lives. Come build with us!

The role

As an Engineer, Data, your mandate is to build the data transformation pipelines & reporting infrastructure that serve our members and run our company. This role will impact ONE’s vision by writing, reviewing, and shipping code and collaborating with others across the company. You will work closely across the Engineering, Product, Design as well as Sales, Compliance and Customer Support team(s) working with stakeholders as highly technical, communicative, and emotionally intelligent partners. This role reports to Manager, Data Engineering.

This role is responsible for:

Building and maintaining ONE's data infrastructure.
Developing and owning ONE's streaming data transformation pipeline.
Managing and supporting reporting and analytics tools.
Collaborating closely with our Data Analysts and Data Scientists.
Tracking and defining metrics around performance.
Additional duties as assigned by your manager.


You bring

Mid Career (5-10 Years)
Experience in Apache Spark, Scala, Python, SQL.
Experience designing and implementing low latency data pipelines using Spark structured streaming.
Experience optimizing SQL queries and lake / warehouse data structures.
Cost-conscience creative problem solving.
Proficient in AWS cloud services and technologies.
Experience building, shipping — and growing — non-trivial products & services.
Passion for your craft, people, and our mission. You value quality across code, communication, and culture.
A desire to keep growing your skills, and an ability to learn quickly. We hire for slope, not just y-intercept.


Pay Transparency

The estimated annual base salary for this position ranges from $175,000 to $190,000. Pay is generally based upon the level, complexity, responsibility, and job duties/requirements of the specific position. We then source candidates with the requisite skills, expertise, education, training, and experience. If you are selected for an interview, please feel welcome to speak to a Talent Partner about our compensation philosophy and other available benefits.

Leveling Philosophy

In order to thoughtfully scale the company and avoid downstream inequities, we’ve adopted a flat titling structure at ONE. Though we may occasionally post a role externally with a prefix such as “Senior” to reflect the external level of the position, we do not use prefixes in titles like that internally unless in a position which manages a team. Internal titles typically include your specific functional responsibility, such as engineering, product management or sales, and often include additional descriptors to ensure clarity of role and placement within our organization (i.e. “Engineer, Platform”, “Sales, Business Development” or “Manager, Talent”). Employees are paid commensurate with their experience and the internal level within ONE.

What it's like working @ ONE

Our teams collaborate remotely and in our work spaces in New York and Sacramento.

Competitive cash
Benefits effective on day one
Early access to a high potential, high growth fintech
Generous stock option packages in an early-stage startup
Remote friendly (anywhere in the US) and office friendly - you pick the schedule
Flexible time off programs - vacation, sick, paid parental leave, and paid caregiver leave
401(k) plan with match


Inclusion & Belonging

To build technology and products that are used and loved by people and solve real-world problems, we need to build a team with many different perspectives and experiences. We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status. We encourage candidates from all backgrounds to apply. Applicants in need of special assistance or accommodation during the interview process or in accessing our website may contact us.

        ","About ONE

ONE is on a mission to help people live healthier financial lives. We’re doing this by creating simple solutions to help our customers save, spend, and grow their money – all in one place.

The U.S. consumer today deserves better. Millions of Americans today can’t access credit, build savings or wealth, and are left to manage their financial lives through multiple disconnected apps. Almost a quarter of U.S. adults are unbanked or underbanked and roughly 80% of fintech users rely on multiple accounts to manage their finances.

What makes us unique? We are backed by a preeminent fintech investor (Ribbit) and the world’s largest retailer (Walmart), maintain the speed and independence of a startup, and employ a strong (and growing) collection of world-class talent.

There’s never been a better moment to build a business that helps people live healthier financial lives. Come build with us!

The role

As an Engineer, Data, your mandate is to build the data transformation pipelines & reporting infrastructure that serve our members and run our company. This role will impact ONE’s vision by writing, reviewing, and shipping code and collaborating with others across the company.

If you are selected for an interview, please feel welcome to speak to a Talent Partner about our compensation philosophy and other available benefits.

Leveling Philosophy

In order to thoughtfully scale the company and avoid downstream inequities, we’ve adopted a flat titling structure at ONE. Though we may occasionally post a role externally with a prefix such as “Senior” to reflect the external level of the position, we do not use prefixes in titles like that internally unless in a position which manages a team. Internal titles typically include your specific functional responsibility, such as engineering, product management or sales, and often include additional descriptors to ensure clarity of role and placement within our organization (i.e. “Engineer, Platform”, “Sales, Business Development” or “Manager, Talent”). Employees are paid commensurate with their experience and the internal level within ONE.

What it's like working @ ONE

Our teams collaborate remotely and in our work spaces in New York and Sacramento.

We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status. We encourage candidates from all backgrounds to apply. Applicants in need of special assistance or accommodation during the interview process or in accessing our website may contact us.

        ","About ONE

ONE is on a mission to help people live healthier financial lives. We’re doing this by creating simple solutions to help our customers save, spend, and grow their money – all in one place.

The U.S. consumer today deserves better. Millions of Americans today can’t access credit, build savings or wealth, and are left to manage their financial lives through multiple disconnected apps. Almost a quarter of U.S. adults are unbanked or underbanked and roughly 80% of fintech users rely on multiple accounts to manage their finances.

What makes us unique? We are backed by a preeminent fintech investor (Ribbit) and the world’s largest retailer (Walmart), maintain the speed and independence of a startup, and employ a strong (and growing) collection of world-class talent.

There’s never been a better moment to build a business that helps people live healthier financial lives. Come build with us!

The role

As an Engineer, Data, your mandate is to build the data transformation pipelines & reporting infrastructure that serve our members and run our company. This role will impact ONE’s vision by writing, reviewing, and shipping code and collaborating with others across the company. You will work closely across the Engineering, Product, Design as well as Sales, Compliance and Customer Support team(s) working with stakeholders as highly technical, communicative, and emotionally intelligent partners. This role reports to Manager, Data Engineering.

This role is responsible for:

Building and maintaining ONE's data infrastructure.
Developing and owning ONE's streaming data transformation pipeline.
Managing and supporting reporting and analytics tools.
Collaborating closely with our Data Analysts and Data Scientists.
Tracking and defining metrics around performance.
Additional duties as assigned by your manager.


You bring

Mid Career (5-10 Years)
Experience in Apache Spark, Scala, Python, SQL.
Experience designing and implementing low latency data pipelines using Spark structured streaming.
Experience optimizing SQL queries and lake / warehouse data structures.
Cost-conscience creative problem solving.
Proficient in AWS cloud services and technologies.
Experience building, shipping — and growing — non-trivial products & services.
Passion for your craft, people, and our mission. You value quality across code, communication, and culture.
A desire to keep growing your skills, and an ability to learn quickly. We hire for slope, not just y-intercept.


Pay Transparency

The estimated annual base salary for this position ranges from $175,000 to $190,000. Pay is generally based upon the level, complexity, responsibility, and job duties/requirements of the specific position. We then source candidates with the requisite skills, expertise, education, training, and experience. If you are selected for an interview, please feel welcome to speak to a Talent Partner about our compensation philosophy and other available benefits.

Leveling Philosophy

In order to thoughtfully scale the company and avoid downstream inequities, we’ve adopted a flat titling structure at ONE. Though we may occasionally post a role externally with a prefix such as “Senior” to reflect the external level of the position, we do not use prefixes in titles like that internally unless in a position which manages a team. Internal titles typically include your specific functional responsibility, such as engineering, product management or sales, and often include additional descriptors to ensure clarity of role and placement within our organization (i.e. “Engineer, Platform”, “Sales, Business Development” or “Manager, Talent”). Employees are paid commensurate with their experience and the internal level within ONE.

What it's like working @ ONE

Our teams collaborate remotely and in our work spaces in New York and Sacramento.

Competitive cash
Benefits effective on day one
Early access to a high potential, high growth fintech
Generous stock option packages in an early-stage startup
Remote friendly (anywhere in the US) and office friendly - you pick the schedule
Flexible time off programs - vacation, sick, paid parental leave, and paid caregiver leave
401(k) plan with match


Inclusion & Belonging

To build technology and products that are used and loved by people and solve real-world problems, we need to build a team with many different perspectives and experiences. We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status. We encourage candidates from all backgrounds to apply. Applicants in need of special assistance or accommodation during the interview process or in accessing our website may contact us.

        ","About ONE

ONE is on a mission to help people live healthier financial lives. We’re doing this by creating simple solutions to help our customers save, spend, and grow their money – all in one place.

The U.S. consumer today deserves better. Millions of Americans today can’t access credit, build savings or wealth, and are left to manage their financial lives through multiple disconnected apps. Almost a quarter of U.S. adults are unbanked or underbanked and roughly 80% of fintech users rely on multiple accounts to manage their finances.

What makes us unique? We are backed by a preeminent fintech investor (Ribbit) and the world’s largest retailer (Walmart), maintain the speed and independence of a startup, and employ a strong (and growing) collection of world-class talent.

There’s never been a better moment to build a business that helps people live healthier financial lives. Come build with us!

        ","Growth is the top priority for every company. Yet the best tools and practices are restricted to a few elite companies who can hire hundreds of engineers and data scientists. Everybody else loses $19 out of every $20 on generic marketing. Mutiny is building a no-code platform that helps companies convert that waste into actual customers and revenue by personalizing experiences based on who is actually viewing. Our greatest differentiator comes from the machine learning models we’ve built that learn across our platform and help our customers make the content changes to convert their prospects.

This problem has not been solved in a decade and we are building an iconic company that will automate growth engineering for every company. That's why Sequoia, YCombinator, and CMOs of companies such as Snowflake and Airbnb invested. Mutiny is beloved by some of the fastest growing companies including Notion, Brex, Carta, Segment, Algolia and Qualtrics. We have quadrupled revenue year-over-year with even more on the horizon!

The role in a nutshell

We are looking for our first data engineer to design the data architecture that will inform strategic business decisions and improve our product for years to come. You will bring together several sources of product and company data into a cohesive and comprehensive data warehouse. You will partner with our finance, data science, and product teams to build ETLs, a shared data vocabulary, and meaningful data abstractions. This is a unique opportunity to be the first in a new function at a scaling startup and build a foundation to scale our data organization.

What you’ll do at Mutiny:

Build and maintain scalable ETL pipelines to efficiently transform data from our source systems into our data warehouse/lake
Design our data architecture and partner with our infrastructure team to make it a reality
Define core data concepts to establish common data-vocabulary
Partner with finance and business operations team to build BI layer
Support product and data science team to build data infrastructure to drive in-app experiences


What you’ll get out of it:

You are joining a rocketship! We are backed by Sequoia Capital, Y Combinator and CMOs from some of today's fastest-growing tech companies including AngelList, Carta, Gong, Hopin, Salesforce, and Snowflake. We are growing incredibly fast and about to hit another inflection point. The potential is unreal. Join and you’ll see what we mean.
You will create a name for yourself by bringing innovative data science solutions never before seen in this category.
You will get exposure to real business problems every company faces (growth) that you can take with you to start your own company (or to help scale another).
You will have fun, plain and simple. There is a reason our first company value is that work should feel like play.
You will experience a new way of working. Our team is fully distributed across the US and EU. But we come together as a company for quarterly offsites (usually in super fun places). This combination of experience-based working is a competitive advantage we plan on leaning into.


What we’re looking for :

5+ yrs experience building and maintaining complex and scalable ETL pipelines
Experience with cloud-based infrastructure (GCP, AWS, etc)
Experience as a senior member of their team, partnering with cross-functional teams
Experience translating business requirements to effective schemas & ETL pipelines
Demonstrated proficiency in Python & SQL
Experience working in user facing products (not solely internal data engineering)
Experience collaborating with data scientists on projects


We are fully remote and offer H1-B Sponsorship.

Mutiny does not accept agency submitted candidates for this posting.","

        ","About ONE

ONE is on a mission to help people live healthier financial lives. We’re doing this by creating simple solutions to help our customers save, spend, and grow their money – all in one place.

The U.S. consumer today deserves better. Millions of Americans today can’t access credit, build savings or wealth, and are left to manage their financial lives through multiple disconnected apps. Almost a quarter of U.S. adults are unbanked or underbanked and roughly 80% of fintech users rely on multiple accounts to manage their finances.

What makes us unique? We are backed by a preeminent fintech investor (Ribbit) and the world’s largest retailer (Walmart), maintain the speed and independence of a startup, and employ a strong (and growing) collection of world-class talent.

There’s never been a better moment to build a business that helps people live healthier financial lives. Come build with us!

As an Engineer, Data, your mandate is to build the data transformation pipelines & reporting infrastructure that serve our members and run our company. This role will impact ONE’s vision by writing, reviewing, and shipping code and collaborating with others across the company.

If you are selected for an interview, please feel welcome to speak to a Talent Partner about our compensation philosophy and other available benefits.

Leveling Philosophy

In order to thoughtfully scale the company and avoid downstream inequities, we’ve adopted a flat titling structure at ONE. Though we may occasionally post a role externally with a prefix such as “Senior” to reflect the external level of the position, we do not use prefixes in titles like that internally unless in a position which manages a team. Internal titles typically include your specific functional responsibility, such as engineering, product management or sales, and often include additional descriptors to ensure clarity of role and placement within our organization (i.e. “Engineer, Platform”, “Sales, Business Development” or “Manager, Talent”). Employees are paid commensurate with their experience and the internal level within ONE.

        ","Changing Healthcare For Good




At Angle Health, we believe the healthcare system should be accessible, transparent, and easy to navigate. As a digital-first, data-driven health plan, we are replacing legacy systems with modern infrastructure to deliver our members the care they need when they need it. If you want to build the future of healthcare, we'd love for you to join us.




The Role




As a Data Engineer on the Strategy team at Angle Health, you will be part of an elite team of problem solvers tackling some of the hardest operational challenges across the business. You will be working closely with Technical Product Managers and other engineers in small teams embedded within functions across the company—from sales to operations to finance and more.




In partnership with operational stakeholders, your job will be to quickly understand business workflows, and design and implement technical, data-driven solutions to achieve the intended business outcomes. That may include architecting backend micro-services, building and maintaining robust data pipelines, standing up health metrics and automated alerts, and developing scalable technical solutions to support Angle Health's day-to-day operations.




Every day will be a new learning experience in this role and may span discussing architecture with fellow engineers, wrangling large-scale data, coding a custom web app or micro-service, or speaking with customers and executives.




This role is ideal for entrepreneurial engineers, applied data scientists, and creative, intellectually curious thinkers that want to solve high-value problems in healthcare.




This position may be based in San Francisco, New York City, Salt Lake City, or Remote.




We are currently trialing various titles for the same role. Please consider the following posted roles as the same position: Deployed Engineer, Software Engineer, Business Operations, and Data Engineer. Please note these are the same, so if you have already applied for one position, there is no need to reapply for the others





What We Value




A strong engineering background in computer science, software engineering, data science, mathematics, or similar technical field is required for this role
Proficiency in programming languages (e.g. Python, SQL, Java, TypeScript/JavaScript, or similar) and data engineering frameworks
A highly analytical mindset and an eagerness to build technical solutions to complex business problems
High attention to detail and intellectual curiosity—you're not satisfied with surface-level answers. You want to dive into the data, the ""how,"" and the ""why"" because ""the way it's always been done"" is not always the way it should be done
Low ego—the outcome matters more than who gets the credit
Demonstrated ability to collaborate effectively in teams of technical and non-technical individuals
Highly organized with an ability to multitask, problem solve, and balance competing priorities in a rapidly changing environment


Because We Value You:




Competitive compensation and stock options
100% company paid comprehensive health, vision & dental insurance for you and your dependents
Supplemental Life, AD&D and Short Term Disability coverage options
Discretionary time off
Opportunity for rapid career progression
Relocation assistance (if relocation is required)
3 months of paid parental leave and flexible return to work policy (after 10 months of employment)
Work-from-home stipend for remote employees
Company provided lunch for in-office employees
401(k) account
Other benefits coming soon!





Backed by a team of world class investors, we are a healthcare startup on a mission to make our health system more effective, accessible, and affordable to everyone. From running large hospitals and health plans to serving on federal healthcare advisory boards to solving the world's hardest problems at Palantir, our team has done it all.

        ","Changing Healthcare For Good




At Angle Health, we believe the healthcare system should be accessible, transparent, and easy to navigate. As a digital-first, data-driven health plan, we are replacing legacy systems with modern infrastructure to deliver our members the care they need when they need it. If you want to build the future of healthcare, we'd love for you to join us.




The Role




As a Data Engineer on the Strategy team at Angle Health, you will be part of an elite team of problem solvers tackling some of the hardest operational challenges across the business. You will be working closely with Technical Product Managers and other engineers in small teams embedded within functions across the company—from sales to operations to finance and more.




In partnership with operational stakeholders, your job will be to quickly understand business workflows, and design and implement technical, data-driven solutions to achieve the intended business outcomes. That may include architecting backend micro-services, building and maintaining robust data pipelines, standing up health metrics and automated alerts, and developing scalable technical solutions to support Angle Health's day-to-day operations.




Every day will be a new learning experience in this role and may span discussing architecture with fellow engineers, wrangling large-scale data, coding a custom web app or micro-service, or speaking with customers and executives.




This role is ideal for entrepreneurial engineers, applied data scientists, and creative, intellectually curious thinkers that want to solve high-value problems in healthcare.




This position may be based in San Francisco, New York City, Salt Lake City, or Remote.




We are currently trialing various titles for the same role. Please consider the following posted roles as the same position: Deployed Engineer, Software Engineer, Business Operations, and Data Engineer. Please note these are the same, so if you have already applied for one position, there is no need to reapply for the others





What We Value




A strong engineering background in computer science, software engineering, data science, mathematics, or similar technical field is required for this role
Proficiency in programming languages (e.g. Python, SQL, Java, TypeScript/JavaScript, or similar) and data engineering frameworks
A highly analytical mindset and an eagerness to build technical solutions to complex business problems
High attention to detail and intellectual curiosity—you're not satisfied with surface-level answers. You want to dive into the data, the ""how,"" and the ""why"" because ""the way it's always been done"" is not always the way it should be done
Low ego—the outcome matters more than who gets the credit
Demonstrated ability to collaborate effectively in teams of technical and non-technical individuals
Highly organized with an ability to multitask, problem solve, and balance competing priorities in a rapidly changing environment


Because We Value You:




Competitive compensation and stock options
100% company paid comprehensive health, vision & dental insurance for you and your dependents
Supplemental Life, AD&D and Short Term Disability coverage options
Discretionary time off
Opportunity for rapid career progression
Relocation assistance (if relocation is required)
3 months of paid parental leave and flexible return to work policy (after 10 months of employment)
Work-from-home stipend for remote employees
Company provided lunch for in-office employees
401(k) account
Other benefits coming soon!





Backed by a team of world class investors, we are a healthcare startup on a mission to make our health system more effective, accessible, and affordable to everyone. From running large hospitals and health plans to serving on federal healthcare advisory boards to solving the world's hardest problems at Palantir, our team has done it all. As part of this core group at Angle Health, you will have the right balance of support and autonomy to grow both personally and professionally and the opportunity to own large parts of the business and scale with the company.
