How does the interview process work?

We start with 1-2 initial conversations about the role, your past experience, and Gridmatic as a company. We then have a skills assessment which involves a take-home project; if that goes well, you’d come onsite to Cupertino to talk to the team.

Recruiting from Scratch is a premier talent firm that focuses on placing the best product managers, software, and hardware talent at innovative companies. Our team is 100% remote and we work with teams across the United States to help them hire. We work with companies funded by the best investors including Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed Ventures, Tiger Global Management, A16Z, Accel, DFJ, and more.




From Our Client

We are seeking a Data Scientist to join our investments team. The Data Scientist’s primary responsibility will be to interpret on-chain data and provide data-driven insights that power investment decisions. This will involve owning all parts of our data science tech stack:




Working closely with our engineering team to build efficient ETL pipelines
Building tools and frameworks to provide scalable data-driven insights
Producing data-driven reports to supplement investment decisions







The essence of the role is to live at the bleeding edge of interpreting on-chain crypto data. For the first time in history, all of the data related to a growing digital economy is open source and available to anyone. However, this data is messy and underexplored. The Data Scientist will be responsible for spearheading our exploration and analysis of on-chain crypto data.







There will be an emphasis on presenting analyses and findings in a digestible form that influence investment decisions. We are looking for a Data Scientist that can translate data driven insights into concise, well written reports.







We work as a cohesive team and expect everybody to think like an owner, not an agent. While the first few months will involve hands-on training, the Data Scientist must be a self starter and independent thinker who can operate with minimal supervision.




Requirements




1-2 years of product/strategy-oriented data science work experience
Strong quantitative and statistical analysis background, including regression, hypothesis testing, clustering analysis, and network analysis
Proficiency using SQL, Git, and Python/R, including standard libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, and Tidyverse
Proven intuition of translating business problems to statistical problems
Excellent written communication
Demonstrated interest in crypto. If you cannot describe what Bitcoin, Ethereum, and DeFi are, then this role is not a fit. Ideally, you are completely obsessed with crypto
Deep curiosity, strong opinions, and intellectual flexibility. If you do not hold strong opinions and almost always agree with the consensus, then this role is not for you
No unchecked egos. We all work towards the collective success of the firm, and do not aim for individual recognition. People who care more about building their personal brands than contributing to building a world-class team need not apply.
Must live or be willing to relocate to NYC. We will be working from the office at least four days per week.

        ","About Us

We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.

We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).

About The Role

You will be a key business partner to the go-to-market leadership team across Sales, Customer Success, Marketing and Revenue Operations. Your work will be instrumental in setting what our data strategy looks like as we design and implement a best-in-class Go-to-Market motion. There will be significant variation from one day to the next, but whether you're exploring what a successful Notion account looks like, building out a core user engagement data set, or creating a model to identify high potential accounts, you'll absolutely be having impact on the direction of the business.

What You'll Achieve


You'll partner with Revenue Operations, Sales, Customer Success, and Marketing leads, driving forward all data science and analytics work in their functional areas
Synthesize insights into crisp narratives and present to senior leadership, and drive and verify change in our business processes. (Insights are useful. Impact is even better!)
You'll build and maintain KPI dashboards that teams rely on for making key decisions, and self-service tools and reports to enable business partners
You'll build models that are core to the operation of the business, such as revenue forecasting or identifying high-value accounts for more hands-on support
Partner closely with our Data Engineering and Business Systems teams to build high fidelity, canonical customer data pipelines


Skills You'll Need To Bring


You've spent meaningful time as a data scientist partnering with Revenue Operations, Sales, Customer Success, Business Operations, and / or Finance related functions

        ","Who is Recruiting from Scratch:

Recruiting from Scratch is a premier talent firm that focuses on placing the best product managers, software, and hardware talent at innovative companies. Our team is 100% remote and we work with teams across the United States to help them hire. We work with companies funded by the best investors including Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed Ventures, Tiger Global Management, A16Z, Accel, DFJ, and more.

From Our Client

We are seeking a Data Scientist to join our investments team. The Data Scientist’s primary responsibility will be to interpret on-chain data and provide data-driven insights that power investment decisions. This will involve owning all parts of our data science tech stack:




1) Working closely with our engineering team to build efficient ETL pipelines

2) Building tools and frameworks to provide scalable data-driven insights

3) Producing data-driven reports to supplement investment decisions




The essence of the role is to live at the bleeding edge of interpreting on-chain crypto data. For the first time in history, all of the data related to a growing digital economy is open source and available to anyone. However, this data is messy and underexplored. The Data Scientist will be responsible for spearheading our exploration and analysis of on-chain crypto data.




There will be an emphasis on presenting analyses and findings in a digestible form that influence investment decisions. We are looking for a Data Scientist that can translate data driven insights into concise, well written reports.




We work as a cohesive team and expect everybody to think like an owner, not an agent. While the first few months will involve hands-on training, the Data Scientist must be a self starter and independent thinker who can operate with minimal supervision.

Requirements

3+ years of product/strategy-oriented data science work experience
Strong quantitative and statistical analysis background, including regression, hypothesis testing, clustering analysis, and network analysis
Proficiency using SQL, Git, and Python/R, including standard libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, and Tidyverse
Proven intuition of translating business problems to statistical problems
Excellent written communication
Demonstrated interest in crypto. If you cannot describe what Bitcoin, Ethereum, and DeFi are, then this role is not a fit. Ideally, you are completely obsessed with crypto
Deep curiosity, strong opinions, and intellectual flexibility. If you do not hold strong opinions and almost always agree with the consensus, then this role is not for you
No unchecked egos. We all work towards the collective success of the firm, and do not aim for individual recognition. People who care more about building their personal brands than contributing to building a world-class team need not apply.
Must live or be willing to relocate to NYC. We will be working from the office at least four days per week.

        ","About Ancestry:

When you join Ancestry, you join a human-centered company where every person’s story is important. We believe that by discovering the struggles and triumphs of our past, we can foster deeper bonds and more meaningful connections among families and communities. With more than 30+ billion digitized global historical records, 125+ million family trees, and 22+ million people in our growing AncestryDNA database, Ancestry helps customers discover their family story and gain a new level of understanding about their lives.

We are committed to our location flexible work approach, allowing you to work from where you want — in an office or from home or a hybrid of both (subject to location restrictions and roles that are required to be in the office). We will continue to hire and promote beyond the boundaries of our office locations, to enable broadened possibilities for employee diversity.

Together, we work every day to foster a work environment that's inclusive as well as diverse, and where our people can be themselves. Every idea and perspective is valued so that our products and services reflect the global and diverse clients we serve.

Recruiting from Scratch is a premier talent firm that focuses on placing the best product managers, software, and hardware talent at innovative companies. Our team is 100% remote and we work with teams across the United States to help them hire. We work with companies funded by the best investors including Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed Ventures, Tiger Global Management, A16Z, Accel, DFJ, and more.




From Our Client

We are seeking a Data Scientist to join our investments team. The Data Scientist’s primary responsibility will be to interpret on-chain data and provide data-driven insights that power investment decisions. This will involve owning all parts of our data science tech stack:




Working closely with our engineering team to build efficient ETL pipelines
Building tools and frameworks to provide scalable data-driven insights
Producing data-driven reports to supplement investment decisions







The essence of the role is to live at the bleeding edge of interpreting on-chain crypto data. For the first time in history, all of the data related to a growing digital economy is open source and available to anyone. However, this data is messy and underexplored. The Data Scientist will be responsible for spearheading our exploration and analysis of on-chain crypto data.







There will be an emphasis on presenting analyses and findings in a digestible form that influence investment decisions. We are looking for a Data Scientist that can translate data driven insights into concise, well written reports.







We work as a cohesive team and expect everybody to think like an owner, not an agent. While the first few months will involve hands-on training, the Data Scientist must be a self starter and independent thinker who can operate with minimal supervision.




Requirements




1-2 years of product/strategy-oriented data science work experience
Strong quantitative and statistical analysis background, including regression, hypothesis testing, clustering analysis, and network analysis
Proficiency using SQL, Git, and Python/R, including standard libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, and Tidyverse
Proven intuition of translating business problems to statistical problems
Excellent written communication
Demonstrated interest in crypto. If you cannot describe what Bitcoin, Ethereum, and DeFi are, then this role is not a fit. Ideally, you are completely obsessed with crypto
Deep curiosity, strong opinions, and intellectual flexibility. If you do not hold strong opinions and almost always agree with the consensus, then this role is not for you
No unchecked egos. We all work towards the collective success of the firm, and do not aim for individual recognition. People who care more about building their personal brands than contributing to building a world-class team need not apply.
Must live or be willing to relocate to NYC. We will be working from the office at least four days per week.

In this role, you will be responsible for implementing innovative image analysis techniques to solve problems that are central to the group’s research objectives. You will also be responsible for applying your analytical methods to large-scale data sets. To accomplish both tasks, you will have the opportunity to collaborate with wider communities of ML and software engineers working at Calico.




Additional job activities will include the oral presentation of methods/results; write-up of methods/results for external publication; and the preparation of code for open-source distribution.




Position Requirements




An MS or PhD in either Computer Science or Biology, or related fields;
2+ years experience applying computer science techniques to the analysis of biological or medical image data (may overlap with degree work);
A history of publication/code release that reflects the successful application of computational image analysis to scientific questions;

Check out our TNC Talent playlist on YouTube or on Glassdoor.




Our goal is to cultivate an inclusive work environment so that all our colleagues around the globe feel a sense of belonging, and that their unique contributions to our mission are valued. We know we’ll only achieve our Mission by hiring and engaging a diverse workforce that reflects the communities in which we work. In addition to the requirements in our postings, we recognize that people come with talent and experiences outside of a job. Diversity of experience and skills combined with passion is a key to innovation and a culture of inclusion! Please apply – we’d love to hear from you. To quote myriad TNC staff members, “you’ll join for our mission, and you’ll stay for our people.”

        ","The company is seeking a Data Scientist to build with us and our community. Come contribute to our growing body of tools, research, and IP that make blockchain and crypto data more accessible.

Who You Are

🧮 You love data and stats. You know some formal statistics, ML, and data exploration techniques, even better if you’ve done network analysis.

🚜 You love crypto and DeFi, know the difference between hodling, staking, and yield farming, and you have used both Ethereum and other chains.

👩‍💻 You are self-directed. You are insatiably curious. You can be counted on to work through a project, commit and go deep while seeking help when you need it, and propel it forward without hand-holding.

📐 You are fastidious and meticulous in your work. You will put in the time to make an order from chaos. You’ve looked into the eye of Sauron and lived to make a graph. You don’t mind doing the “grunt work” to build up to the full picture, or go as low as it takes? Muckraking? More like fun-making.

🎨 You're creative and you aren't afraid to be wrong.

❄️ You are super comfortable in SQL-like databases (we use Snowflake)

®️ You are intimately familiar with R for analysis, exploration, and model-building. And you have an opinion about data. table vs dplyr. Python is OK too, but we have a lot of R code, so you need to be comfortable there.

🏳️‍🌈 You take pride in your code. It's readable, functional, and reproducible. You commit regularly for all the right reasons.

🧑‍🏫 You can describe a complex problem (or solution) in a way that doesn't put people to sleep and doesn't leave them scratching their heads.

What You'll Work On

Work directly with the company's community, our internal analytics & data platform teams.

Collaborate with other data scientists and analysts to explore, visualize, and validate our data.

Work closely with our marketing team to share what we learn with the world, and educate anyone who wants to learn more.

Support the efforts of our product teams to help transform our apps into more data-driven, web3-connected, powerful experiences for our growing base of thousands of users.

Desired Experience

Experience with Crypto/Blockchain is a requirement.

Prior experience as an analyst or data scientist, working directly with database-level data, whether formally or self-taught.

At least 2 years in a formal data science role, ideally working primarily in R

Experience working with product & marketing teams, developers, and data engineers

Position Overview




Galen College of Nursing is looking for a Data Scientist to continuously improve the student experience in an exceptional learning environment. To accomplish this, we rely on data driven decision making and innovation. The role requires working closely with others, frequently in a matrixed environment, and with little supervision. 'Self-starters' who are proficient in problem solving and capable of bringing clarity to complex situations are encouraged to apply. Galen places an emphasis on teamwork, so social and interpersonal skills are equally important as technical capability. The position requires that one stay well-informed of technological advancements and be proficient at putting new innovations into effective practice.




This role is firmly customer facing, with an expectation of constant contact, communication, and iteration across college and program leadership to define questions, explore solutions and present results. As such the Data Scientist must be comfortable and capable of clearly communicating the nature and results of complex analytics to non-technical users in written, spoken, and visual means.




Responsibilities




Ensure a consistent and scalable approach in data analysis
Develop knowledge management tools that allow leaders to identify the information that matters most across the student's lifecycle which will enable the use of data in the design and implementation of effective student support and intervention.
Develop and maintains reports, dashboards, databases, and other visual aids in support of findings, for a variety of technical and non-technical audiences.
Analyze and interpret quantitative and qualitative data from multiple sources and synthesize results into actionable recommendations.
Apply expert analytics and technical interpretation to provide highly creative solutions.
Proficiency in the operational and software aspects of data science and the application of traditional and newly developing statistical methods.
Develop deep expertise in working with academic, operational, and financial data.
Work on unique and complex problems.
Consult and collaborate across functional and departmental lines in building, managing, and producing data models.




Qualifications




Education: Master's Degree required; PhD preferred.




Experience: 5 plus years required in higher ed (preferred). On the technical front the Data Scientist must be comfortable with 'data wrangling'. That is, the ability to identify, and extract raw data from primary transactions systems such as Ellucian's Colleague SIS and Canvas LMS databases. Thereafter they must possess skills in programming to manage, transform and integrate with other datasets, in preparation for analytics.




Special Qualifications: The analytic skills required are based principally in statistics and data visualization.
